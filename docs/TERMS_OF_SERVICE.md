### Indeed (indeed.com / au.indeed.com)

✅ **SUPPORTED VIA MANUAL IMPORT** ✅

**Official Policy:**
- Indeed's Terms of Service **explicitly prohibit** automated web scraping without written permission
- Violating ToS may breach Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the U.S.
- Official APIs available for authorized partners (ATS, publishers) only

**applyr's Compliant Approach: Manual Import**

applyr supports Indeed via **manual text file import** instead of automated scraping:

**How It Works:**
1. User visits Indeed job page in browser (normal use)
2. User manually copies page content (Cmd+A, Cmd+C / Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. User saves content to `data/raw/jobs/{job_id}.txt`
4. User runs `applyr add-job {job_id}` or `applyr add-job "{url}"`
5. System reads text file and extracts job data (no web requests to Indeed)

**Why This Is Compliant:**
- ✅ **No automated scraping**: User manually views and copies content
- ✅ **No circumvention**: No attempts to bypass Indeed's anti-bot measures
- ✅ **Personal use**: User copies content they're viewing for their own job tracking
- ✅ **No HTTP requests**: System only processes user-provided text files
- ✅ **Standard browser use**: User interacts with Indeed normally

**Why Automated Scraping Is Not Used:**

1. **Active Blocking (403 Errors)**
   - Indeed actively detects and blocks automated scraping attempts
   - Returns 403 Forbidden responses to non-browser clients
   - Sophisticated fingerprinting technology prevents automated access
   - More aggressive anti-bot measures than other job boards

2. **Official API Limitations**
   - **No job search/retrieval API**: APIs only support posting jobs TO Indeed
   - **Partner-only access**: Requires business partnership agreements
   - **Not for individuals**: Designed for ATS/recruitment platforms at enterprise scale
   - **Commercial pricing**: Undisclosed costs, not available to personal users

3. **Available APIs (All Partner-Only)**
   - **Job Sync API**: Post jobs TO Indeed (employers/ATS)
   - **Disposition Sync API**: Sync candidate status updates
   - **Indeed Apply**: Application process integration
   - All require business partnership, OAuth 2.0, and commercial agreements

**Usage Instructions:**

```bash
# 1. Visit https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=cc76be5d850127ec
# 2. Select all (Cmd+A or Ctrl+A) and copy (Cmd+C or Ctrl+C)
# 3. Save to data/raw/jobs/cc76be5d850127ec.txt
# 4. Run command:
applyr add-job cc76be5d850127ec
# or
applyr add-job "https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=cc76be5d850127ec"
```

See `data/raw/jobs/README.md` for detailed instructions.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Pros**: ToS compliant, no blocking, integrates with applyr
- ⚠️ **Cons**: Requires manual copy/paste step (not fully automated)

## Legal Considerations

### Web Scraping Legality

Web scraping exists in a legal gray area:

**Generally Legal:**
- Accessing publicly available information
- Personal, non-commercial use
- Respecting robots.txt
- Not circumventing technical barriers

**Potentially Illegal:**
- Violating explicit Terms of Service
- Commercial scraping without permission
- Bypassing access controls or authentication
- Causing excessive server load or harm
- Republishing copyrighted content

**Relevant Laws:**
- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** - U.S. law prohibiting unauthorized computer access
- **Copyright Law** - Job postings may be copyrighted content
- **Contract Law** - ToS violations may constitute breach of contract
- **Data Protection Laws** - GDPR, CCPA may apply to personal data handling

### Best Practices for Legal Compliance

1. **Use for Personal Purposes Only**
   - Track jobs you're actively applying to
   - Do not create commercial databases
   - Do not republish or sell scraped content

2. **Respect Rate Limiting**
   - Use default delays (2+ seconds between requests)
   - Do not modify rate limits to scrape faster
   - Stop if you receive 403/blocking responses

3. **Honor robots.txt**
   - Check each site's robots.txt file
   - Respect disallowed paths
   - Follow crawl-delay directives

4. **Consider Official APIs**
   - Use official APIs when available
   - Contact sites about partnership opportunities
   - Respect API rate limits and quotas

5. **Minimize Server Impact**
   - Scrape only what you need (individual jobs)
   - Cache results to avoid repeated requests
   - Use off-peak hours when possible

## applyr's Built-in Protections

### Rate Limiting
- **Default delay**: 2.0 seconds between requests
- **Configurable**: Users can increase (but not decrease) delays
- **Enforced**: Automatic sleep between all requests
- **Logged**: All requests are logged for transparency

### ToS Warnings
- **First-use warnings**: Displayed on first scrape per source
- **Documentation**: This comprehensive ToS guide
- **Logging**: All scraping activity logged with warnings
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of 403/blocking

### Respectful Headers
- **Browser-like**: Standard User-Agent strings
- **Transparent**: Does not hide scraping activity
- **Standard protocols**: Uses normal HTTP requests
- **No circumvention**: Does not bypass security measures

### Personal Use Scope
- **Individual jobs**: Designed for one-by-one tracking
- **Application focus**: Tied to application workflow
- **No bulk features**: No mass harvesting capabilities
- **Database tracking**: Links to personal application records
