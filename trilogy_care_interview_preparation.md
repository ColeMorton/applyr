#### **Healthcare/Accessibility Connection:**
*"While my fintech background might seem different from aged care, both require the same attention to accessibility, compliance, and user trust. In financial applications, we design for users who need clear, simple interfaces - exactly what aged care technology demands."*

#### **Problem-Solving Example:**
Prepare a specific technical challenge you solved, focusing on:
- Problem identification
- Solution architecture  
- Technical implementation
- Impact measurement

---

## **PHASE 5: COMPANY-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS & ANSWERS** ‚ùì

### **Questions You MUST Ask:**

#### **Technology & AI Strategy:**
- "How does the AI-first philosophy translate to day-to-day development decisions?"
- "What's the current tech debt situation as you've scaled from startup to 7th largest provider?"
- "How do you balance AI automation with maintaining the human touch in care?"

#### **Team & Culture:**
- "What does successful collaboration look like between product, UX, and engineering here?"
- "How do you approach mentoring and knowledge sharing in the engineering team?"
- "What's the most exciting technical challenge the team is working on right now?"

#### **Growth & Career:**
- "With the Support at Home program launching in November 2025, how is engineering preparing?"
- "What career progression looks like for someone starting in this role?"
- "How does the engineering team contribute to the broader company mission?"

### **Questions You'll Be Asked (Prepare Answers):**

#### **"Why Trilogy Care?"**
*"Three things drew me here: First, your AI-first philosophy aligns perfectly with how I approach problem-solving - not adding AI as an afterthought, but building it into the foundation. Second, the mission resonates with me - using technology to give people more time to care fits my values. Third, the technical challenges of building scalable, compliant, accessible software for aged care users is exactly the kind of complex problem I want to solve."*

#### **"How do you handle compliance requirements?"**
*"In my fintech work, I've dealt with strict regulatory requirements. I approach compliance as a design constraint, not an afterthought. For healthcare, I understand WCAG 2.2 accessibility standards, data privacy requirements, and the need for audit trails in everything we build."*

#### **"Tell me about a time you worked with AI."**
*Use your Sensylate example in detail, focusing on architecture decisions and real impact.*
