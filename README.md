## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements

```bash
# Install Poetry (if not already installed)
pip install poetry

# Install project dependencies
poetry install
```

**Dependencies:**
- `requests>=2.31.0`
- `beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0` 
- `lxml>=4.9.0`
- `markdown>=3.5.0`
- `weasyprint>=60.0`
- `pandas>=2.0.0`

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Scrape Individual Job Posting
```bash
python scripts/job_scraper/seek_scraper.py --url "https://www.seek.com.au/job/86524100"
```

#### 2. Batch Process Multiple Jobs
```bash
python scripts/job_scraper/batch_scrape_jobs.py
```

#### 3. Generate Market Intelligence Report
```bash
python scripts/job_scraper/aggregate_jobs.py
```

#### 4. Test Single Job Processing
```bash
python scripts/job_scraper/test_single_job.py
```

#### 5. Convert Markdown to PDF
```bash
# Convert single file
applyr pdf README.md

# Generate all resume formats at once
applyr resume-formats data/raw/resume.md

# Convert with specific template
applyr pdf resume.md --css-file applyr/styles/executive.css

# Batch convert entire directory
applyr pdf data/outputs/cover_letters --batch --output output_pdfs/

# Validate PDF quality
applyr validate-pdf resume_executive.pdf --detailed
```

## 📁 Data Structure

applyr organizes all outputs under `data/` with clear separation:

```
data/
├── raw/                        # Raw data and application database
│   └── advertisements.csv      # Central job application tracking database
└── outputs/
    ├── job_descriptions/       # Latest batch (Sept 12, 2025)
    │   ├── 20250912_job_descriptions_aggregate.md
    │   └── [individual job files]
    ├── job_descriptions_1/     # Previous batch (Sept 2, 2025)
    │   ├── 20250902_job_descriptions_aggregate.md
    │   └── [individual job files]
    └── cover_letters/          # Personalized cover letters
        ├── squiz.md
        ├── trilogy_care.md
        └── [company-specific letters]
```

### Data Relationship Model

The system maintains a **1:1 correspondence** between job descriptions and advertisement tracking records:

- **Job Descriptions** (`data/outputs/job_descriptions/*.md`): Full job posting content in markdown format
- **Advertisements** (`data/raw/advertisements.csv`): Application tracking database with status management

**Key Relationship**: Both are linked by `job_id` - the 8-digit SEEK identifier that serves as the primary key across both data sources.

**Example**:
- Job Description: `87066700_iSelect_Ltd_Software_Engineer.md`
- CSV Record: `87066700,iSelect Ltd,Software Engineer,SEEK,applied,medium,...`

This dual storage pattern enables:
- **Rich Content Access**: Full job descriptions for analysis and cover letter generation
- **Application Tracking**: Status management and lifecycle tracking in structured CSV format
- **Data Integrity**: Guaranteed 1:1 mapping through job_id primary key

### Application Database Schema

The core application tracking database (`data/raw/advertisements.csv`) uses this schema:

```csv
job_id,company_name,job_title,source,status,priority,date_discovered,date_applied,date_closed,notes,salary_min,salary_max,location,url
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `job_id`: 8-digit SEEK job identifier (Primary Key)
- `company_name`: Company name (normalized for cover letter matching)
- `job_title`: Job position title
- `source`: Job board source (SEEK, LinkedIn, etc.)
- `status`: Application status (discovered, interested, applied, interviewed, rejected, closed)
- `priority`: Target priority (high, medium, low)
- `date_discovered`: Date job was scraped (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `date_applied`: Date application was submitted (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `date_closed`: Date position was closed/filled (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `notes`: Free-text notes about application/company
- `salary_min/max`: Salary range if available
- `location`: Job location
- `url`: Original job posting URL

### File Naming Conventions

- **Individual Jobs**: `{job_id}_{company}_{title}.md` 
  - `job_id`: 8-digit SEEK identifier (links to advertisements.csv)
  - Example: `87066700_iSelect_Ltd_Software_Engineer.md`
- **Aggregate Reports**: `YYYYMMDD_job_descriptions_aggregate.md`
- **Cover Letters**: `{company_name}.md`

**Critical**: The `job_id` prefix in job description filenames **must match** the `job_id` field in `advertisements.csv` to maintain data integrity across the dual storage system.

### Data Integrity & Workflow

The applyr system maintains strict data integrity through its dual storage architecture:

1. **Scraping Phase**: When a job is scraped from SEEK:
   - Creates markdown file: `{job_id}_{company}_{title}.md`
   - Adds CSV entry: `{job_id},company,title,SEEK,discovered,...`

2. **Application Tracking**: Status updates modify CSV only:
   - `status` field: discovered → applied → interviewed → rejected/closed
   - Markdown files remain unchanged (preserve original job content)

3. **Data Lookup**: Any operation requiring full job details:
   - Use `job_id` from CSV to locate corresponding markdown file
   - Example: CSV shows job 87066700 → Read `87066700_iSelect_Ltd_Software_Engineer.md`

**Validation**: The system ensures every CSV entry has a matching markdown file and vice versa.

## 💼 Usage Examples

### Supported Job Boards

applyr supports multiple job boards with automatic source detection:

| Job Board | Input Format | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **SEEK** | 8-digit job ID or full URL | `87066700` or `https://www.seek.com.au/job/87066700` |
| **Employment Hero** | Full URL | `https://jobs.employmenthero.com/AU/job/company-position-id` |
