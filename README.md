```

**Dependencies:**
- `requests>=2.31.0`
- `beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0` 
- `lxml>=4.9.0`
- `markdown>=3.5.0`
- `weasyprint>=60.0`
- `pandas>=2.0.0`

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Scrape Individual Job Posting
```bash
python scripts/job_scraper/seek_scraper.py --url "https://www.seek.com.au/job/86524100"
```

#### 2. Batch Process Multiple Jobs
```bash
python scripts/job_scraper/batch_scrape_jobs.py
```

#### 3. Generate Market Intelligence Report
```bash
python scripts/job_scraper/aggregate_jobs.py
```

#### 4. Test Single Job Processing

# Convert with custom CSS
applyr pdf README.md --css-file applyr/styles/professional.css

# Batch convert entire directory
applyr pdf data/outputs/cover_letters --batch --output output_pdfs/
```

## üìÅ Data Structure

applyr organizes all outputs under `data/` with clear separation:

```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw/                        # Raw data and application database
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ advertisements.csv      # Central job application tracking database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ job_descriptions/       # Latest batch (Sept 12, 2025)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 20250912_job_descriptions_aggregate.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [individual job files]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ job_descriptions_1/     # Previous batch (Sept 2, 2025)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 20250902_job_descriptions_aggregate.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [individual job files]
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cover_letters/          # Personalized cover letters
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ squiz.md
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trilogy_care.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [company-specific letters]
```

### Data Relationship Model

The system maintains a **1:1 correspondence** between job descriptions and advertisement tracking records:

- **Job Descriptions** (`data/outputs/job_descriptions/*.md`): Full job posting content in markdown format
- **Advertisements** (`data/raw/advertisements.csv`): Application tracking database with status management

**Key Relationship**: Both are linked by `job_id` - the 8-digit SEEK identifier that serves as the primary key across both data sources.

**Example**:
- Job Description: `87066700_iSelect_Ltd_Software_Engineer.md`
- CSV Record: `87066700,iSelect Ltd,Software Engineer,SEEK,applied,medium,...`

This dual storage pattern enables:
- **Rich Content Access**: Full job descriptions for analysis and cover letter generation
- **Application Tracking**: Status management and lifecycle tracking in structured CSV format
- **Data Integrity**: Guaranteed 1:1 mapping through job_id primary key

### Application Database Schema

The core application tracking database (`data/raw/advertisements.csv`) uses this schema:

```csv
job_id,company_name,job_title,source,status,priority,date_discovered,date_applied,date_closed,notes,salary_min,salary_max,location,url
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `job_id`: 8-digit SEEK job identifier (Primary Key)
- `company_name`: Company name (normalized for cover letter matching)
- `job_title`: Job position title
- `source`: Job board source (SEEK, LinkedIn, etc.)
- `status`: Application status (discovered, interested, applied, interviewed, rejected, closed)
- `priority`: Target priority (high, medium, low)
- `date_discovered`: Date job was scraped (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `date_applied`: Date application was submitted (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `date_closed`: Date position was closed/filled (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `notes`: Free-text notes about application/company
- `salary_min/max`: Salary range if available
- `location`: Job location
- `url`: Original job posting URL

### File Naming Conventions

- **Individual Jobs**: `{job_id}_{company}_{title}.md` 
  - `job_id`: 8-digit SEEK identifier (links to advertisements.csv)
  - Example: `87066700_iSelect_Ltd_Software_Engineer.md`
- **Aggregate Reports**: `YYYYMMDD_job_descriptions_aggregate.md`
- **Cover Letters**: `{company_name}.md`

**Critical**: The `job_id` prefix in job description filenames **must match** the `job_id` field in `advertisements.csv` to maintain data integrity across the dual storage system.

### Data Integrity & Workflow

The applyr system maintains strict data integrity through its dual storage architecture:

1. **Scraping Phase**: When a job is scraped from SEEK:
   - Creates markdown file: `{job_id}_{company}_{title}.md`
   - Adds CSV entry: `{job_id},company,title,SEEK,discovered,...`

2. **Application Tracking**: Status updates modify CSV only:
   - `status` field: discovered ‚Üí applied ‚Üí interviewed ‚Üí rejected/closed
   - Markdown files remain unchanged (preserve original job content)

3. **Data Lookup**: Any operation requiring full job details:
   - Use `job_id` from CSV to locate corresponding markdown file
   - Example: CSV shows job 87066700 ‚Üí Read `87066700_iSelect_Ltd_Software_Engineer.md`

**Validation**: The system ensures every CSV entry has a matching markdown file and vice versa.
