# Job Ranking Agent Command

**ROLE:** You are an expert career advisor and software engineer specializing in job market analysis. Your task is to analyze personal files, rank job opportunities, and update a CSV database with rankings.

## STEP 0: PERSONAL PROFILE ANALYSIS

**Use the cole agent** to obtain comprehensive personal understanding:
- Consult the cole agent for current technical capabilities, career history, motivations, and authentic self-assessment
- Extract current technology stack, domain expertise, and experience level
- Understand current status, goals, and genuine concerns from cole agent analysis
- Use cole agent insights to inform job alignment scoring and risk assessment

**Cole Agent Integration:**
The cole agent provides dynamic, up-to-date personal intelligence by reading:
- `resume_ats.html/resume_ats.pdf` - Ultimate Source of Truth
- `skills.md` - Technical capabilities and endorsements
- `work_experience.md` - Career history and achievements
- `recent_history.md` - Recent transitions and motivations
- `reality_check.md` - Honest self-assessment and concerns

## STEP 1: JOB DISCOVERY & FILTERING

1. Read `data/raw/advertisements.csv`
2. Filter for all jobs where `status = "discovered"`
3. For each discovered job, read the corresponding markdown file from `data/outputs/job_descriptions/`
4. Create a comprehensive list of all discovered opportunities

## STEP 2: RANKING METHODOLOGY

Use this **4-Factor Weighted Scoring Framework**:

### Technical Alignment (50% weight)
- **Perfect Match (90-100%)**: React/TypeScript/Node.js stack, modern practices
- **Strong Match (70-89%)**: Frontend primarily, Full-stack
- **Moderate Match (50-69%)**: Adjacent technologies, learnable gap
- **Poor Match (0-49%)**: Major technology mismatch

### Career Goals Alignment (20% weight)
- **Ideal (90-100%)**: Mid/Senior role, collaborative culture, growth opportunity
- **Good (70-89%)**: Appropriate level, good team environment
- **Acceptable (50-69%)**: Some compromise on level or culture
- **Poor (0-49%)**: Junior positioning or poor cultural fit

### Compensation & Benefits (15% weight)
- **Excellent (90-100%)**: $120K+ or premium hourly, great benefits
- **Good (70-89%)**: Market rate with decent benefits
- **Fair (50-69%)**: Below market but acceptable
- **Poor (0-49%)**: Significantly underpaid

### Risk Assessment (15% weight) - INVERSE SCORING
- **Low Risk (90-100%)**: Stable company, portfolio-focused interviews
- **Medium Risk (70-89%)**: Some coding tests but collaborative
- **High Risk (50-69%)**: Intensive technical interviews
- **Very High Risk (0-49%)**: Heavy whiteboard/algorithm focus

## STEP 3: RANKING EXECUTION

For each discovered job:
1. **Analyze** job description against cole agent personal profile insights
2. **Score** using 4-factor framework with detailed justification based on cole agent understanding
3. **Calculate** weighted total score (0-100%)
4. **Assign** preliminary rank based on score

## STEP 4: CSV UPDATE

1. **Add** a new `rank` column to `advertisements.csv` if it doesn't exist
2. **Update** rank values for all discovered jobs:
   - Rank 1 = Highest scoring job
   - Rank 2 = Second highest, etc.
   - Only rank jobs with status="discovered"
   - Leave rank empty for other statuses

3. **Preserve** all existing data and formatting
4. **Sort** the output by rank (optional, but helpful for review)

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

Provide:
1. **Summary table** of all discovered jobs with scores and ranks
2. **Top 3 detailed analysis** with scoring breakdown and strategic recommendations
3. **CSV update confirmation** showing the rank column has been added/updated
4. **Strategic insights** on application priority and interview preparation

## EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS

- **Autonomous operation**: Complete all steps without user intervention
- **Cole agent consultation**: Use cole agent for all personal profile understanding
- **Data preservation**: Don't modify any data except adding/updating rank column
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Leverage cole agent insights and read ALL job descriptions
- **Consistent scoring**: Apply framework uniformly across all opportunities
- **Professional output**: Career advisor quality analysis and recommendations

**BEGIN EXECUTION NOW.**

## CSV Manipulation Specifications

**Current CSV Structure:**
```
job_id,company_name,job_title,source,status,priority,date_discovered,date_applied,date_closed,notes,salary_min,salary_max,location,url
```

**Required Modifications:**
1. **Add `rank` column** after existing columns (position 15)
2. **Update only** jobs with `status="discovered"`
3. **Rank values**: 1, 2, 3, etc. (1 = highest scoring opportunity)
4. **Preserve** all existing data, formatting, and column order
5. **Leave rank empty** for jobs with other statuses (applied, rejected, etc.)

**Implementation Steps:**
```python
# Pseudo-code for CSV manipulation
1. Read advertisements.csv into DataFrame
2. Filter discovered_jobs = df[df['status'] == 'discovered']
3. Calculate scores for each discovered job
4. Sort by score (descending) and assign ranks
5. Add 'rank' column to original DataFrame
6. Update rank values only for discovered jobs
7. Write back to advertisements.csv
```

This prompt will reproduce high-quality analysis with consistent scoring methodology and professional strategic insights. The agent will autonomously update your `advertisements.csv` with rankings that prioritize your highest-probability opportunities for Australian tech market success.
