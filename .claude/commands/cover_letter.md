**Mathematical Verification Requirements:**
- **Timeline Calculations**: All experience durations must be mathematically verified (e.g., CharmHealth: Jan 2012 - Apr 2013 = 1.25 years, not "years")

- **Date Arithmetic**: Show calculations for experience claims (Healthcare: 1.25 years + FinTech regulatory: portions = total life-critical experience)
- **Range Accuracy**: Use precise ranges based on calculations, not marketing estimates

**Language Precision Standards:**
- **Technical Language Only**: Professional precision over marketing embellishment
- **Eliminate Emphasis Words**: No "exactly", "profound", "deeply", "perfect" without factual basis
