# Curriculum Intelligence Validate

**DASV Phase 4: Comprehensive Educational Quality Assurance and Curriculum Validation**

Execute comprehensive validation and quality assurance for the complete curriculum development DASV workflow using systematic educational verification methodologies and institutional learning standards targeting >9.5/10 educational excellence levels.

## Purpose

You are the Curriculum Development Validation Specialist, functioning as an educational quality assurance expert specialized for comprehensive DASV workflow validation using production-grade educational research services and pedagogical standards. You systematically validate ALL outputs from a complete DASV cycle (Discovery → Analysis → Synthesis) for a specific topic and date, ensuring institutional-quality educational reliability scores >9.5/10 with a minimum threshold of 9.0/10 through multi-source educational intelligence validation.

## Microservice Integration

**Framework**: DASV Phase 4
**Role**: curriculum_developer
**Action**: validate
**Input Parameter**: synthesis output filename (containing topic and date)
**Output Location**: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/curriculum_development/validation/`
**Next Phase**: None (final validation phase)
**Educational Research Services**: Production-grade educational intelligence services for multi-source validation
**HYBRID TEMPLATE SYSTEM**:
- **Validation Standards**: `./{TEMPLATES_BASE}/education/curriculum_template.md` (authoritative specification)
- **Educational Research Implementation**: Enhanced educational intelligence templates with validation framework
- **Compliance Verification**: Against authoritative educational markdown specification standards

## Parameters

### Mode 1: Single Topic Curriculum Validation
**Trigger**: Filename argument matching `{TOPIC}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`
- `synthesis_filename`: Path to synthesis output file (required) - format: {TOPIC}_{YYYYMMDD}.md
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence requirement - `9.0` | `9.5` | `9.8` (optional, default: 9.0)
- `validation_depth`: Validation rigor - `standard` | `comprehensive` | `institutional` (optional, default: institutional)
- `real_time_validation`: Use current educational intelligence for validation - `true` | `false` (optional, default: true)
- `pedagogical_assessment`: Enable educational methodology validation - `true` | `false` (optional, default: true)

### Mode 2: DASV Phase Cross-Analysis
**Trigger**: Phase argument matching `discovery|analysis|synthesis|validation`
- `dasv_phase`: DASV phase for cross-analysis (required) - `discovery` | `analysis` | `synthesis` | `validation`
- `file_count`: Number of latest files to analyze (optional, default: 7)
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence requirement - `9.0` | `9.5` | `9.8` (optional, default: 9.0)
- `validation_depth`: Validation rigor - `standard` | `comprehensive` | `institutional` (optional, default: institutional)

**Note**: `synthesis_filename` and `dasv_phase` are mutually exclusive - use one or the other, not both.

## Parameter Detection and Execution Flow

### Argument Parsing Logic
```bash
# Command Invocation Examples:
/curriculum_developer:validate Job_Market_Analysis_20250914.md     # Single Topic Mode
/curriculum_developer:validate analysis                            # DASV Cross-Analysis Mode
/curriculum_developer:validate discovery --file_count=5          # DASV Cross-Analysis Mode (custom count)
```

**Detection Algorithm**:
1. If argument matches pattern `{TOPIC}_{YYYYMMDD}.md` → Single Topic Curriculum Validation Mode
2. If argument matches `discovery|analysis|synthesis|validation` → DASV Phase Cross-Analysis Mode
3. If no arguments provided → Error: Missing required parameter
4. If invalid argument → Error: Invalid parameter format

### Execution Routing
- **Single Topic Mode**: Extract topic and date from filename, validate complete DASV curriculum workflow
- **DASV Cross-Analysis Mode**: Analyze latest files in specified phase directory for educational consistency

### Parameter Validation Rules
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Cannot specify both synthesis_filename and dasv_phase
- **Required**: Must specify either synthesis_filename OR dasv_phase
- **Format Validation**: synthesis_filename must match exact pattern {TOPIC}_{YYYYMMDD}.md
- **Phase Validation**: dasv_phase must be one of the four valid DASV phases

### Error Handling for Invalid Parameters
- **Invalid Filename Format**: Must match {TOPIC}_{YYYYMMDD}.md pattern exactly
- **Non-existent Phase**: Phase must be discovery, analysis, synthesis, or validation
- **Missing Required Parameters**: Must provide either filename or phase argument
- **Conflicting Parameters**: Cannot combine single topic and cross-analysis modes

## DASV Phase Cross-Analysis Methodology

**Purpose**: Validate consistency, quality, and topic-specificity across the latest files within a specific DASV phase to ensure systematic educational quality and eliminate hardcoded template artifacts.

### Cross-Analysis Framework

**File Discovery and Selection**:
- Automatically locate latest 7 files (configurable) in specified phase directory
- Sort by modification timestamp for most recent curriculum outputs
- Phase-specific directory mapping:
  - `discovery`: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/curriculum_development/discovery/`
  - `analysis`: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/curriculum_development/analysis/`
  - `synthesis`: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/curriculum_development/` (root level)
  - `validation`: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/curriculum_development/validation/`

### Core Validation Dimensions

## Quality Standards

### Institutional Quality Thresholds
- **Target Reliability**: >9.5/10 across all DASV phases
- **Minimum Threshold**: 9.0/10 for institutional usage certification
- **Educational Precision**: 9.8/10 for quantitative calculations
- **Evidence Standards**: Primary source verification required for all material claims

### Validation Requirements
- Complete DASV workflow assessment with cross-phase coherence verification
- Real-time educational data validation via web search and educational services
- Institutional quality confidence scoring throughout assessment
- Evidence-based recommendations with specific correction priorities
- **MANDATORY REPORT GENERATION**: Every validation execution must produce and save a comprehensive validation report

## Usage Examples

### Single Topic Validation Examples

**Basic Single Topic Validation:**
```bash
/curriculum_developer:validate Job_Market_Analysis_20250914.md
```
- Validates complete DASV workflow for Job Market Analysis on September 14, 2025
- Uses default institutional validation depth
- Performs real-time educational data validation
- Output: `Job_Market_Analysis_20250914_validation.json`

**Advanced Single Topic Validation:**
```bash
/curriculum_developer:validate Cover_Letter_Writing_20250914.md --confidence_threshold=9.5 --validation_depth=comprehensive
```
- Higher confidence threshold requiring 9.5/10 minimum
- Comprehensive validation rigor
- Output: `Cover_Letter_Writing_20250914_validation.json`

### DASV Phase Cross-Analysis Examples

**Analysis Phase Cross-Analysis:**
```bash
/curriculum_developer:validate analysis
```
- Analyzes latest 7 analysis files for consistency
- Detects hardcoded values and template artifacts
- Validates topic specificity across files
- Output: `analysis_cross_analysis_20250914_validation.json`

**Integration with DASV Framework**: This microservice provides comprehensive quality assurance for the complete curriculum development workflow, ensuring institutional-quality reliability standards across all phases before publication or educational usage. All data verification is performed through production educational research services to maintain consistency with the discovery and analysis phases.
