# Curriculum Intelligence Discover

**DASV Phase 1: Topic-Based Learning Content Discovery and Resource Aggregation**

Comprehensive educational content discovery engine that systematically searches project data repositories and supplements with current web research to create the foundation for ultimate learning materials on any subject.

## Purpose

The Curriculum Development Discovery phase defines requirements for systematic collection and initial structuring of all learning resources required for comprehensive topic-based curriculum development. This specification focuses on **what** educational content is needed rather than **how** to obtain it, delegating technical implementation to the researcher sub-agent.

**Expected Output Schema**: `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/curriculum_discovery_schema.json`
**Researcher Sub Task**: Use the researcher sub-agent to execute educational content discovery. Ensure output conforms to `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/curriculum_discovery_schema.json`.
