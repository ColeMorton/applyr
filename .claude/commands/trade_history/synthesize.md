# Trade History Synthesize

**DASV Phase 3: Trading Performance Content Specification**

Comprehensive report generation and document creation for institutional-quality trading performance communication using systematic synthesis protocols and advanced content generation methodologies.

## Purpose

The Trading Performance Synthesis phase represents the systematic integration and presentation of trading data and analysis into professional reports tailored for different audiences. This command provides the requirements for the "Synthesize" phase of the DASV (Discover → Analyze → Synthesize → Validate) framework, focusing on multi-audience document generation, template compliance, and actionable insight presentation.

**Expected Output Schema**: `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/trade_history_synthesis_schema.json`
**Researcher Sub Task**: Use the researcher sub-agent to execute trade history synthesis. Ensure output conforms to `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/trade_history_synthesis_schema.json`.

## Microservice Integration

**Framework**: DASV Phase 3
**Role**: trade_history
**Action**: synthesize
**Input Sources**: trade_history_discover, trade_history_analyze
**Output Location**: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/trade_history/`
**Next Phase**: trade_history_validate
**Template Reference**: `./{TEMPLATES_BASE}/analysis/trade_history_template.md` (institutional-quality structure matching fundamental analysis standards)
