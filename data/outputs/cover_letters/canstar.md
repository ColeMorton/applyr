## Dear CANSTAR Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Developer position at CANSTAR. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission of empowering consumers to make informed financial decisions through comprehensive product comparisons and expert ratings.

- **TypeScript**: 6+ years from Oetker Digital through current development projects including [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **Node.js**: 2+ years backend development including API services and GraphQL implementations

I'm excited to **master Angular 2+**, building on my **3+ years of AngularJS 1 experience** and recent **NextJS competency** demonstrated in challenge [tc-code-challenge-node-01](https://github.com/ColeMorton/tc-code-challenge-node-01) and active project [Zixly](https://github.com/ColeMorton/zixly).

## Agile Team Collaboration & DevOps Excellence

Your emphasis on **cross-functional agile teams** and **atlassian suite proficiency** aligns perfectly with my collaborative development experience:

This collaborative foundation ensures seamless integration into your **cross-functional Agile team** while contributing to **code quality standards** and **continuous improvement** initiatives.

## FinTech & Regulated Industry Expertise

Your focus on **financial product comparisons and regulatory compliance** aligns perfectly with my regulated industry experience:

- **FinTech Platform Leadership**: CrossLend - Maintained platform stability and regulatory compliance throughout scaling from 3 to 20+ developers
- **Financial API Integration**: 20+ financial APIs integrated in [Sensylate](https://github.com/colemorton/sensylate) platform, demonstrating complex system integration capabilities
