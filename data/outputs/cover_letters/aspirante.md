## Dear Aspirante,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior UI Developer position. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to Queensland Online's mission of delivering accessible, user-friendly web experiences for the Queensland government.

## Great Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for engineers with expertise in **HTML5, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React** aligns directly with my core technology stack:

- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript**: 11+ years foundation from front-end development experience.
- **TypeScript**: 5+ years from Market Logic (2016) through current [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) development
- **React**: 8+ years from CrossLend (2015) "first exposure" through React 19 implementation in current projects
- **Build Tools**: Extensive experience with NPM, Webpack (Oetker Digital), Gulp (Advertile, Crosslend), covering your NPM/Webpack/Vite requirements
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest/Cypress (Oetker Digital), Karma/Protractor (Dievision), aligning with your VITest/Jest/Cypress stack

While I haven't worked with **Squiz Matrix CMS** specifically, my experience over the past year building a GenContentOps project, [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) presented through my [personal website](https://colemorton.com), has provided deep experience into content management.

## Brisbane Establishment & Immediate Availability

Having relocated to Brisbane with my architect wife to "start a new life and put down roots" with our family alreadt here, I'm fully committed to Australia's thriving tech market and immediately available to contribute to your Queensland government projects. My **full Australian work rights** (New Zealand citizen) ensure seamless onboarding for this 6-month contract with extension potential.

## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of:

- **Perfect Frontend Stack Alignment**: 8+ years React, 5+ years TypeScript, 11+ years HTML/CSS/JavaScript with modern build tools
- **Team Leadership Capability**: Successfully scaled teams from 3‚Üí20 developers while maintaining regulatory compliance
- **Immediate Brisbane Availability**: Established family commitment with full work rights and contract availability

...can contribute to Queensland Online's mission of delivering exceptional user experiences.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities through technical assessment or portfolio review of my current [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) project.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
