## Dear Resly Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Developer position at Resly. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission to empower independent hoteliers through innovative property management solutions.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your React, NextJS, Node.js, and TypeScript stack aligns perfectly with my experience:

- **React**: 9+ years across multiple companies (CrossLend, Market Logic, Panorama Berlin, Oetker Digital) through current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ implementation
- **NextJS**: Current production experience with NextJS 15.5.5 building [Zixly](https://github.com/ColeMorton/zixly) business automation service (N8N, Vercel, Supabase) and completed [coding challenge](https://github.com/ColeMorton/tc-code-challenge-node-01) using App Router, Prisma ORM, and TypeScript
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years from Oetker Digital (2018-2020) through current development projects including [personal website](https://colemorton.com) and [Zixly](https://zixly.vercel.app/)
- **Node.js**: 7+ years backend development including Express.js, Apollo GraphQL, and API services at Oetker Digital, Panorama Berlin, and Crosslend
- **JavaScript**: 11+ years with **19 LinkedIn endorsements** (highest-endorsed skill) spanning full-stack development

I'm excited to expand my experience with GCP and Firebase, my current NextJS 15 + PostgreSQL architecture in Zixly provides an excellent foundation for Resly's stack.

## Direct Hotel/Tourism Software Experience

My background in hospitality technology makes me uniquely positioned for this role:

- **Oetker Digital (2018-2020)**: Part-time Senior Software Engineer for 2 years 4 months building **rapid PWA and SPA prototypes for restaurants, hotels and businesses**. Delivered **hotel admin prototype** using React.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL
- **Full-Stack Ownership**: Solo developer on Panorama Berlin React Native app (2018) - complete ownership from frontend to Node.js/Express.js backend to PostgreSQL database with production deployment
- **AI Platform Architecture**: [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) platform demonstrates architectural capability with 20+ financial API integrations and multi-phase agentic workflows

This direct hospitality domain experience combined with full-stack depth positions me to contribute immediately to Resly's property management platform.

Your emphasis on flexibility, creativity, and being at the forefront of hotel tech innovation matches my entrepreneurial mindset and commitment to building meaningful software solutions.

## Brisbane Establishment & Immediate Availability

Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to start our new life and put down roots with close family here. As a New Zealand citizen, I have full Australian work rights without visa complications. I'm fully committed to Australia's thriving tech market and immediately available to contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities through technical discussions about your architecture or code reviews of my [GitHub projects](https://github.com/colemorton).

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
