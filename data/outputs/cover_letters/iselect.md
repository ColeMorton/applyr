## Dear iSelect Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at iSelect. As a full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience** who recently relocated to Brisbane from Berlin, I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to a platform that helps millions of Australians make better financial decisions.

## Why I'm a Strong Match for iSelect

Your requirement for engineers who can "build great software" with expertise in **React, JavaScript, Node.js, and AWS** aligns directly with my core technical strengths. I've spent the past year building Sensylate, a financial analysis platform that **integrates 18+ third-party APIs** to deliver institutional-grade insights. I understand exactly the kind of scalable, reliable systems needed for comparison services at iSelect's scale.

The merger with Compare the Market presents fascinating technical challenges around platform consolidation, data unification, and architectural modernization. My experience transitioning from monolithic systems to microservices architectures at multiple Berlin startups has prepared me well for these exact challenges.

## Relevant Technical & Domain Experience

My career has progressively built toward the intersection of software engineering and financial services:

**API Integration & Data Processing Expertise**:
- Built [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate), integrating **18+ financial and market data APIs** with intelligent caching and validation
- Implemented contract-driven data pipelines ensuring accuracy and reliability at scale
- Created comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms for third-party service failures

**Full-Stack Development Excellence**:
- **React/TypeScript**: Primary frontend stack for the past 5+ years across multiple companies
- **Node.js**: Extensive backend experience building RESTful APIs and microservices
- **AWS**: Deployed production systems using Lambda, S3, API Gateway (requiring refresh but foundational knowledge strong)
- **Java/C#**: While Java isn't my primary language, I have **3 years of C#/.NET experience** providing strong OOP foundation

**Financial Services Domain Knowledge**:
- At **CrossLend GmbH** (Berlin fintech), developed lending platform interfaces requiring precision accuracy
- Deep understanding of financial products, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance
- Built systematic approaches to financial data validation and quality assurance

**Collaborative Team Experience**:
- Worked across **12+ teams** throughout my career using Agile/Scrum methodologies
- At **Oetker Digital**, collaborated across multiple projects in highly dynamic environment
- Consistently bridged technical and business stakeholders to deliver customer value

## What I Bring to iSelect

Beyond technical skills, I understand the critical importance of building systems that earn consumer trust when handling financial decisions. My recent work has taught me that comparison services aren't just about data aggregation, they're about presenting complex information in ways that empower confident decision-making.

I'm particularly excited by iSelect's focus on **AI and multi-agent systems**. My experience with AI orchestration and automated content generation directly applies to enhancing comparison algorithms and creating more intelligent advisory services. I see tremendous potential in using AI not to replace human advisors but to augment their capabilities and scale personalized guidance.

## Cultural Alignment & Commitment to Melbourne

While currently Brisbane-based, I'm prepared to relocate to Melbourne for the right opportunity. Having spent 12 years in Berlin's tech scene, I understand the value of being present with the team, especially during significant technical transformations. Your Collins Square location and hybrid work arrangements (including the 9-day fortnight option) align well with my work-life balance priorities.

I'm drawn to iSelect's mission of making complex financial decisions simpler for everyday Australians. After years in European markets, I'm eager to contribute to Australia's tech ecosystem while applying international perspectives to local challenges.

## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of:
- Deep technical expertise in your core stack
- Extensive API integration and financial systems experience  
- Fresh perspectives from international markets
- Genuine passion for consumer-focused technology

...can contribute to iSelect's continued evolution as Australia's trusted comparison platform.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities through technical discussions, pair programming, or building a sample integration showcasing real iSelect use cases.

Best regards,  
Cole Morton
