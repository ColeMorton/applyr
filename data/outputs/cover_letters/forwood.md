## Dear Forwood Safety Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the AI Co-Pilot Full Stack Developer position at Forwood Safety. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with 11+ years of commercial experience and cutting-edge AI-augmented workflows, I'm excited to contribute to your mission to achieve zero workplace fatalities. Your authentic commitment to health and safety represents exactly the type of meaningful impact I want my engineering skills to support.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your React/Remix + TypeScript frontend and NestJS/AWS backend stack aligns well with my experience:

- **React & TypeScript**: 10+ years since early adoption at CrossLend (2015) through current React 19 implementation in my [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) AI platform
- **Node.js Foundation**: Extensive backend development including Express.js and REST APIs
- **AI-First Development**: Daily Claude Code and Cursor IDE workflows since August 2024, the exact tools you've embraced for accelerated delivery
- **Testing Transition**: Strong Cypress experience with eagerness to adopt Playwright for your quality standards

I'm excited to deepen my NestJS expertise, my Node.js foundation provides an excellent base for quickly mastering your full technology stack.

## Regulated Systems & Safety-Critical Experience

Your safety-critical mission resonates deeply with my background in compliance critical systems:

- **Healthcare Compliance**: Built oncology patient management systems for Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where "strict regulatory compliance" was essential where errors could impact patient outcomes
- **FinTech Scaling**: Led frontend development at CrossLend's regulated lending platform while scaling the team from 3 to 20+ developers, maintaining platform stability under regulatory scrutiny

This experience in healthcare and financial services has instilled the production mindset your safety technology demands: robust, maintainable, enterprise-ready systems with rigorous testing, code reviews, and quality assurance. Understanding Forwood's 30-year evolution from consulting to AI-powered platform, I appreciate how safety technology requires the same uncompromising standards I applied in regulated environments.

## AI Leadership & Mentoring Alignment

Your AI-first development culture and mentorship values align perfectly with my leadership experience:

- **Team Scaling Leadership**: Guided new developers through complex onboarding at CrossLend while maintaining rapid feature delivery
- **AI Workflow Mastery**: Recent transition to AI-first development gives me firsthand appreciation for both acceleration potential and validation discipline
- **Modern Practices**: Deep understanding of balancing velocity with quality through proper code reviews and continuous improvement

I'm excited to share knowledge about structuring effective prompts, implementing robust testing workflows, and ensuring AI-assisted code meets the enterprise standards your life-saving mission demands.

## Ready to Ship Life-Saving Software

Your vision perfectly aligns with where I want to focus my technical skills: leveraging AI-augmented workflows to accelerate delivery of life-protecting software. With venture capital backing from Macquarie Capital and Centerstone Capital positioning Forwood for rapid growth, I bring the React/TypeScript expertise, AI mastery, and regulated systems background needed to contribute immediately to your expanding platform.

I'm excited to discuss how my experience in AI-first development and team scaling can contribute to Forwood Safety's mission of making every workplace fatality-free.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my AI-first development experience and safety-critical systems background can contribute to Forwood's continued mission success.

Best regards,
