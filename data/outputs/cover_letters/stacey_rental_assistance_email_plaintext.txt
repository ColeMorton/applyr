SUBJECT: Stacey – We would appreciate your help finding our next home

Hi Stacey,

I hope you're having a great week! I wanted to reach out as Naz and I have started to look for a new rental.
We would like to secure a new place as soon as possible and would really value your expertise.

We're looking for:

• Property type: 2+ bedrooms (house, townhouse, or apartment – we're flexible)
• Budget: Maximum $800/week
• Location: North Brisbane preferred (15-20km from CBD), but open to other areas
• Must-have: Pet-friendly for our cat, Billy.

As you know from our tenancy at Rode road, we've maintained a great track record with zero issues. Our financial position is strong:

• Naz has been working at LandPartners MNG since March (7 months). $100k salary, stable employment with verifiable income.
• I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 11 years' international experience, actively interviewing for positions in the $100-120k range (this will be my first role in Australia)
• Combined household income will be $210,000+ once I secure employment
• Combined investment portfolio and savings ($140k+)
• Established banking with NAB with regular services/utility payments since February
• References available immediately

We understand that property owners can reluctant or hesitant to accept pets. Billy's well-behaved, property-respecting, and we've had zero pet-related issues at any rentals.

Given our excellent track record with you, I'm hoping you might be able to:

• Alert us to any upcoming listings matching our criteria
• Share realistic insights about current availability and competition in our budget range
• Let us know if there are any properties in your Ray White network that might suit

We're available for inspections on short notice.
I realise that you have most information from us, let me know if it could be helpful to provide anything additional.
We're looking for a long-term home, ideally 12+ months.

I really appreciate any guidance you can offer.
Please let me know if you need any additional information from us, or if there's anything we should be doing differently in this market.

Thanks so much for your time and assistance, Stacey. Looking forward to hearing from you!
