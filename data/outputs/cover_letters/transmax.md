## Dear Transmax Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Front-End Developer position at Transmax. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission to conceive, develop, and deliver platforms that reduce congestion, improve safety, and enhance the lives of millions of Australians every day.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for **React and TypeScript expertise** aligns perfectly with my experience:

- **React**: 9 years including Progressive Web Apps, Dashboards, Search UI, Content Management, Mobile (React Native), and much more.
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years experience from Oetker Digital (2018) through current [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: 11+ years with 19 LinkedIn endorsements for JavaScript (highest of all skills)

Where I'm particularly excited to develop expertise in your **backend systems**, my React/JavaScript foundation and cross-functional collaboration experience provide an excellent base for quickly mastering your full technology stack.

## Regulated Systems & Government Sector Experience

My experience delivering systems for life-critical and regulated environments aligns with Transmax's government sector focus:

- **Healthcare Compliance**: CharmHealth hospital systems - oncology and patient management system at Chris O'Brien Lifehouse
- **FinTech Regulations**: CrossLend scaling from 3 to 20+ developers while maintaining platform stability and regulatory compliance
- **Enterprise Standards**: Lead front-end developer on 3 enterprise projects with proven systems design and management skills

This regulated industry background translates directly to understanding the precision, reliability, and compliance requirements essential for traffic management systems that serve millions of commuters daily.

## Innovation Leadership & Team Collaboration

Your product-trio-model resonates strongly with my cross-functional collaboration experience:

- **Cross-Functional/Team Collaboration**: At Oetker Digital, I worked across multiple teams (product, team, marketing, devops) in fast-paced, adaptive environment with seamless collaboration.
- **Technical Leadership**: Successfully guided front-end architecture decisions across multiple on-going projects

## Brisbane Establishment & Immediate Availability

Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to be closer to family and put down roots. She is currently working as an architect at LandPartners (opposite the Transmax building). I'm fully committed to Australia's thriving tech market and immediately available to contribute to your team.

## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my combination of:

- **Perfect technical stack alignment** 9 years React, 6+ years TypeScript, modern frontend expertise
- **Proven regulated industry expertise** Healthcare + FinTech compliance with scaling experience
