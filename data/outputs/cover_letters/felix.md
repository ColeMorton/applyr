## Dear Felix Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at Felix. As a full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience** who recently relocated to Brisbane from Berlin, I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to Felix's mission of transforming procurement in the construction industry.

**Why I'm a Strong Match for Felix**

Your requirement for React.js, Redux, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and Git expertise aligns directly with my professional background. Since my time at CrossLend GmbH in Berlin (**2016**), I worked extensively with **React.js and Redux**. Additionally, I have driven all development workflows with **Git** since **2013**. I've spent the past year developing Sensylate, a financial analysis solution that integrates 18+ third-party APIs into a insitutional-grade DevContentOps solution, giving me deep experience with exactly the kind of API integration and data management challenges that are central to procurement platforms.

**Relevant Technical Experience**

My career has focused on flexibility and dynamism to deliver innovative solutions:
- At Dievision Agentur, I led front-end development for a major German bank's platform using modern JavaScript frameworks
- At CrossLend (fintech), I integrated frontend with PHP and MySQL to build B2B financial systems requiring precision accuracy
- At Market Logic Software, I encapsulated complex backend search logic into a beautiful, easy to use UI using React.js and modern tech stack.
- At Advertile Mobile, I worked with a tight-knit team engaged in all areas of SDLC including product and system design.
- At Panorama Berlin, I personally developed a React.js PWA QR Code app to accompany a large fashion event.
- At Oetker Digital, Doctor Oetker startup incubator. I worked on many projects in all areas from inception, prototyping, to production.
- Sensylate GevContentOps and personal Website. Fusion of generative AI using Claude and Python data pipelines presented by a Typescript and React.js frontend: [colemorton.com](https://www.colemorton.com) 

I have consistently demonstrated my ability to quickly master new technologiesâ€”transitioning from .NET to JavaScript ecosystems (and beyond), and more recently incorporating AI tools and DevContentOps into my development workflow.

**What I Bring to Felix**

Beyond technical skills, I understand the importance of building software that solves real business problems. My experience across multiple industries and innovative products taught me how to design systems that integrate disparate data sources seemlessly into a fluent UX.

I'm particularly drawn to Felix for the opportunity to contribute to a growing ASX-listed company. After establishing myself in Berlin's tech scene for 12 years, my wife (architect/BIM coordinator) and I chose Brisbane to be close to family, and I'm eager to establish myself in the local tech community while contributing to a product that serves the Australian construction industry.

**Next Steps**

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my deep experience in translating complex business context in actionable requirements, coordinating with stakeholders on acceptance criteria, deliverying and operating robust web solutions could contribute to Felix's continued growth, especially as you integrate new acquisitions and expand your platform capabilities.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of joining your team and helping build the future of procurement technology.

Best regards,  
Cole Morton
