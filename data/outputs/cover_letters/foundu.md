## Dear foundU Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Front-End Developer position at foundU. As a full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience** who recently relocated to Brisbane from Berlin, I'm excited to join Australia's thriving tech scene.

**Why I'm a Strong Match for foundU**

Your focus on building and maintaining a comprehensive component library immediately resonated with me. At **Panorama Berlin (2018)** and then later at Oetker Digital, I used Storybook daily for for UI component design and theming. This experience taught me how well-architected component libraries become force multipliers for product teams and designers, enabling rapid feature delivery while maintaining consistency and quality.

**Notable Technical Experience**

My career has progressively built the exact skills foundU needs:

**Leading Frontend Frameworks** (2013-2025):
- Worked in frontend teams across multiple organizations using React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript, and various CSS frameworks
- At **CrossLend GmbH** (Berlin fintech), developed frontend and managed dashboards for a business-to-business lending platform
- At **Oetker Digital**, worked in a highly dynamic environment building reusable components across React and Vue projects
- At **Market Logic Software**, built a search UI using React, Styled Components, Redux, and ImmutableJS with focus on reusability
- Consistently implemented atomic design methodology and component-driven development

**Testing & Quality**:
- Implemented comprehensive testing strategies using Jest and Cypress at multiple companies
- Strong advocate for TDD (test-driven development) and code review practices
- Experience with CI/CD pipelines and Github Actions

**What I Bring to foundU**

From the first day in the industry, I observed how communication skills are paramount. The ability to simplify complex technical concepts for stakeholders of various backgrounds is critical for harmonious collaboration. I strive to understand the complete business context, requirements and acceptance criteria clearly and comprehensively. I'm enthusiastic and optimisitc, which allows me to work well with others. When it comes to problem solving, I apply critical thinking and first principles in order to conceptualize the most robust optimal solutions.

**Cultural Alignment**

After 12 years in Berlin's startup scene, I'm drawn to foundU's emphasis on collaborative culture. Your company culture, team lunches, and focus on internal promotion align perfectly with what I'm seeking in my next role. The tight-knit Brisbane tech community you describe mirrors the collaborative environment I thrived in at Berlin startups.

**Next Steps**

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience, skills and how I can contribute to foundU's continued growth, particularly as you integrate with Citation Group and scale to serve more businesses across Australia and New Zealand.

I'm particularly interested in learning about your frontend architecture roadmap and how you're approaching the standardization challenges that come with rapid growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to foundU's mission!

Best regards,  
Cole Morton

**Note:** I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my component architecture approach through a practical coding session or by sharing examples from my recent projects. I'm also actively familiarizing myself with Australian workplace regulations to better understand the domain.
