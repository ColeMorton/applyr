## Dear Forwood Safety Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Mobile Engineer position at Forwood Safety. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience** and cutting-edge AI-augmented workflows, I'm excited to contribute to your mission to achieve zero workplace fatalities. Your authentic commitment to safety‚Äîrooted in Steve Wood's personal experience‚Äîrepresents exactly the type of meaningful impact I want my engineering skills to support.

## AI-First Development: Core Strength

Your emphasis on **AI copilots (CursorAI, Claude Code, Copilot)** aligns perfectly with my current development approach:

- **Daily AI-Augmented Development**: Everything built since August 2024 through Cursor IDE and Claude Code‚Äîthe exact tools you've embraced
- **AI Agent Orchestration**: [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) platform demonstrates sophisticated AI-driven architecture with 20+ API integrations
- **Production Systems at Scale**: Built and maintaining enterprise-grade systems with AI-assisted workflows while ensuring code quality and reliability
- **Modern Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript implementation in current projects, providing strong foundation for React Native

I bring hands-on experience designing AI-assisted workflows while maintaining enterprise-grade quality standards.

## Mobile Development Foundation

Your React Native + Expo stack aligns with my experience:

- **React Native**: Built production mobile app deployed to both iOS and Android for live event usage (fashion show QR scanning system)
- **React**: 9+ years commercial experience through current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ implementation
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years commercial experience through current development projects
- **Component Architecture**: Extensive experience with component-based development across React, Vue.js, and Angular

**Flutter**: My React Native foundation and component-based thinking provide a strong base for quickly mastering Dart and Flutter's reactive paradigm.

## Safety-Critical Systems Experience

Your life-saving mission aligns with my background in compliance-critical environments:

- **Healthcare Compliance**: CharmHealth - Built oncology and patient management system for Chris O'Brien Lifehouse where strict regulatory compliance was core to all business logic
- **FinTech Regulatory**: CrossLend - Maintained platform stability and regulatory compliance throughout scaling from 3 to 20+ developers
- **Production Reliability**: Panorama Berlin - Monitored live production through Sentry during high-stakes fashion event, ensuring flawless QR scanning functionality

This experience in healthcare and financial services has instilled the production mindset your safety technology demands: robust, maintainable, life-protecting systems where software accuracy directly impacts human outcomes. My team scaling experience at CrossLend (3‚Üí20 developers) aligns with your emphasis on mentoring engineers through AI-first workflows.

## Brisbane Establishment & Remote-First Alignment

Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to start our new life and put down roots, with close family connections here. As a New Zealand citizen, I have full Australian work rights without visa complications.

Your **remote-first, global team** structure aligns perfectly with my international experience working across Germany, Australia, and New Zealand timezones while maintaining effective collaboration.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and eager to demonstrate how my AI-first development experience and safety-critical systems background can contribute to Forwood's mission of making every workplace fatality-free.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
