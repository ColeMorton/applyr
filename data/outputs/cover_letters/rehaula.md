# Dear Rehaula Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Mid to Senior Website Developer position at Rehaula. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission of transforming technical brilliance into brands people believe in.

## Perfect Technical Foundation Alignment

Your requirement for expertise in **WordPress, Webflow, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integrations** aligns strongly with my technical foundation:

- **HTML/CSS**: 14+ years with comprehensive experience across modern frameworks and responsive design principles
- **JavaScript**: 11+ years with **19 LinkedIn endorsements** (my highest-endorsed skill), including modern frameworks and API integration
- **API Integration**: 20+ financial APIs integrated in my Sensylate platform, demonstrating complex system integration capabilities
- **CMS Architecture**: Extensive backend experience with .NET, Node.js, and Python providing excellent foundation for WordPress development

While I'll be transitioning into WordPress specifically, my **comprehensive web architecture experience** and proven ability to rapidly master new technology stacks positions me well for quickly excelling with your WordPress and Webflow requirements.

## Mission-Driven Technical Translation Experience

Your focus on **transforming technical brilliance into compelling brands** resonates deeply with my background:

- **Technical Communication**: Experience as lead frontend developer on major banking projects, translating complex requirements between technical teams and business stakeholders
- **Mission-Driven Leadership**: Founded non-profit blockchain cooperative (2017-2020) exploring decentralized economy participation, demonstrating genuine commitment to meaningful technology work
- **Agency Experience**: 1 year 11 months at Dievision Agentur f√ºr Kommunikation GmbH, providing direct consultancy environment experience

Your vision of making "the complex compelling for those solving our world's biggest challenges" aligns perfectly with my goal to build high-quality software solutions that create meaningful impact.

## Brisbane Establishment & Perfect Availability Match

I'm optimally positioned for your part-time to full-time transition model. Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to start our new life and put down roots. She has close family here and is currently working as an architect.

With **3+ years of successful remote collaboration** across international teams and proven ability to deliver complex projects independently, I'm immediately available for your 20-hour weekly commitment with enthusiasm for growing into full-time as your website department expands.

## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of:

- **Strong Technical Foundation**: 14+ years HTML/CSS/JavaScript with rapid technology adoption capability
- **Project Leadership Experience**: Scaled development teams from 3 to 20+ developers with proven client-facing capabilities
- **Mission-Driven Background**: Non-profit leadership and commitment to meaningful technical solutions
- **Perfect Availability**: Brisbane-established with immediate part-time availability and full-time growth potential

...can contribute to Rehaula's vision of elevating world-changing brands through effective technical execution.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and excited to demonstrate how my technical architecture experience and mission alignment can help build and lead the delivery of websites that transform technical brilliance into compelling brand stories.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
