## Dear iSelect Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at iSelect Ltd. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission of helping millions of Australians find the right financial and household products through trusted comparison services.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for engineers with expertise in **JavaScript (React) and Node.js** aligns perfectly with my experience:

- **JavaScript**: 11+ years with 19 LinkedIn endorsements, from .NET enterprise foundations to modern React/TypeScript stacks
- **React**: 8+ years from first exposure at CrossLend FinTech (2015) to current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ on [colemorton.com](https://colemorton.com)
- **Full-Stack Development**: Proven experience building both financial user interfaces and backend systems with regulatory compliance
- **Agile Methodologies**: 7 LinkedIn endorsements with practical Scrum/Kanban experience, implementing TDD at CrossLend during team scaling from 3‚Üí20+ developers
- **AI & Multi-Agent Systems**: Current specialization with sophisticated AI agent orchestration system generating 100+ analyses through multi-phase workflows
- **SOLID Principles**: Primary skill with 11+ years applying clean architecture patterns in enterprise-scale production systems

Your emphasis on **AI and multi-agent systems** directly aligns with my current AI-augmented development focus on [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate), while **Agile** matches my primary commercial workflow experience.

While I have a strong foundation in OOP through 3.7 years of C#/.NET enterprise development, I'm excited to apply this architectural understanding to Java environments. My regulated industry background provides excellent context for understanding secure, scalable enterprise systems.

## Modern Development & Collaboration Excellence

Your emphasis on **"collaborate widely with product owners, PMs, and architects, explaining tech in plain language"** resonates strongly with my cross-functional experience:

- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: At Oetker Digital, worked across multiple teams in fast-paced, adaptive environment with seamless collaboration between business and technical stakeholders
- **Client-Facing Technical Communication**: Led frontend project for major German banking client at Dievision, translating technical requirements into business-friendly solutions
- **Team Leadership & Knowledge Sharing**: Successfully scaled CrossLend development team from 3 to 20+ developers while maintaining platform stability and maintaining CI/CD practices

This collaborative approach directly supports your culture of turning ideas into working solutions while maintaining the high engineering standards essential for financial services.

## Regulated Industry Expertise

My experience with compliance-critical systems directly aligns with financial services requirements:

- **Healthcare Compliance**: Built oncology and patient management system for Chris O'Brien Lifehouse at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, where regulatory compliance was core to all business logic
- **FinTech Regulatory**: Maintained platform stability and regulatory compliance at CrossLend GmbH (Jul 2015 - Jun 2016), navigating German financial regulations

This combination of healthcare and FinTech compliance experience provides unique understanding of the accuracy, precision, and trust requirements essential for financial comparison services.

## Brisbane Establishment & Immediate Availability

Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to be closer to family and put down roots. I'm fully committed to Australia's thriving tech market and immediately available to contribute to your team and drive your mission.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
