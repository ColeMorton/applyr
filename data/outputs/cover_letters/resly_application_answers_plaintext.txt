QUESTION 1: Explain your frontend and backend testing experience.

Frontend Testing (4+ years documented experience):

I have comprehensive frontend testing experience across multiple frameworks and environments:

Enterprise Banking Application (Dievision, 2013-2015):
As lead frontend developer for a major German banking client, I implemented a comprehensive testing strategy using Karma and Protractor, ensuring robust unit and end-to-end test coverage across the AngularJS application for nearly 2 years.

Hospitality SaaS Development (Oetker Digital, 2018-2020):
Used Jest and Cypress extensively for 2+ years while building PWA and SPA solutions for restaurants, hotels, and businesses. This experience directly translates to testing modern React applications with similar architecture to Resly's platform.

Current Projects:
My Zixly platform (https://github.com/ColeMorton/zixly) (NextJS 15.5.5) and coding challenge (https://github.com/ColeMorton/tc-code-challenge-node-01) include Playwright testing configuration, demonstrating current best practices with modern testing frameworks.

Backend Testing (8+ years documented experience):

Test-Driven Development (CrossLend FinTech, 2015-2016):
Practiced TDD and Continuous Integration in a regulated FinTech environment where accuracy and compliance were essential. Maintained platform stability while scaling from 3 to 20+ developers.

Node.js API Testing (Oetker Digital & Panorama Berlin, 2018-2020):
Tested Express.js and Apollo GraphQL backends with Jest, ensuring reliable API endpoints for production hospitality applications.

Healthcare Compliance Testing (CharmHealth, 2012-2013):
Built oncology and patient management systems for Australian hospitals where strict regulatory compliance was baked into all business logic, requiring comprehensive testing at every layer.

Current Python Projects:
Active Pytest usage in my Sensylate platform (https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) (20+ API integrations) and quantitative trading systems (1M+ strategy permutations requiring validation).

Testing Philosophy:
I prioritize comprehensive test coverage with focus on business-critical paths, especially in regulated or life-critical systems. My experience spans unit testing, integration testing, E2E testing, and TDD methodologies.

================================================================================

QUESTION 2: Do you have TypeScript, Next.js or GCP experience?

Yes, I have substantial experience with TypeScript and Next.js:

TypeScript (6+ years production experience):
- Oetker Digital (2018-2020): 2+ years building hotel/restaurant PWA solutions with React + TypeScript
- Current Projects: TypeScript in Zixly platform (https://github.com/ColeMorton/zixly) (NextJS 15.5.5), personal website (https://colemorton.com) (Astro 5.12+), and coding challenge (https://github.com/ColeMorton/tc-code-challenge-node-01)
- Strict Mode: All current projects use TypeScript in strict mode for maximum type safety

Next.js (Current active experience):
- Production Platform: Zixly business automation service (https://github.com/ColeMorton/zixly) built with NextJS 15.5.5 + React 19, deployed on Vercel (29 commits, actively developed)
- Technical Implementation: App Router architecture, Prisma 6.x ORM, PostgreSQL (Supabase), Supabase Auth, API routes
- Coding Challenge: Completed Trilogy Care challenge (https://github.com/ColeMorton/tc-code-challenge-node-01) using NextJS 15 with App Router, demonstrating structured code organization
- Recent Training: Completed Next.js course to formalize framework knowledge

GCP Experience:
I don't have direct production Google Cloud Platform experience. However, I have extensive cloud infrastructure experience with:
- Vercel: Current deployment platform for Zixly (NextJS hosting)
- AWS/Cloud Architecture: Understanding of cloud-native architectures, serverless patterns, and managed services
- Database Services: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Firebase-adjacent tooling
- Quick Learning: My transition from React to NextJS demonstrates ability to rapidly master new platforms within the Google/Vercel ecosystem

I'm excited to expand my GCP knowledge, and my current NextJS + Vercel + Supabase architecture provides excellent foundation for Firebase and GCP integration.

================================================================================

QUESTION 3: Have you worked in a small, agile software team?

Yes, small agile teams are where I thrive. My most impactful experience:

CrossLend FinTech (2015-2016) - Startup Scaling:
I joined as the third developer in a regulated FinTech startup and helped grow the development team from 3 to 20+ developers over 12 months. This experience gave me deep insight into small team dynamics:
- Early Stage (3-5 developers): Direct collaboration, rapid iteration, wearing multiple hats
- Growth Phase (5-10 developers): Establishing processes while maintaining agility
- Scaling Phase (10-20 developers): Maintaining code quality and regulatory compliance at scale

Other Small Team Experiences:

Panorama Berlin (2018): Solo developer delivering a production React Native app for a fashion show event. Close collaboration with CTO led to immediate invitation to join Oetker Digital.

Advertile Mobile (2017): 7 months in an "extremely tight-knit, friendly and intelligent team" with strong emphasis on supporting each other and meeting objectives with high efficiency.

Market Logic Software (2016-2017): Small specialized team building React search UI for enterprise clients.

Agile Methodology:
- LinkedIn Endorsements: 7 endorsements for Agile Methodologies
- Practices: Scrum, Kanban, Test-Driven Development, Continuous Integration
- CrossLend Context: FinTech environment required structured Agile practices while maintaining startup speed

Resly Alignment:
Your 1-10 employee team structure perfectly matches my experience. I understand the dynamics of small teams where every contribution matters, communication is direct, and adaptability is essential.

================================================================================

QUESTION 4: Why are you looking to leave your current role?

I'm transitioning back to team-based development after a deliberate period of independent technical leadership.

2020-2024 Timeline:

After working at CrossLend FinTech (2015-2016), I developed a strong interest in financial markets. As that interest grew, I decided to dedicate increasing time to it, eventually pursuing it full-time in 2020.

What I Built:

Quantitative Trading Systems (2022-present):
Developed comprehensive Python-based trading toolkit processing 1M+ strategy permutations across multi-decade datasets with advanced risk analytics.

Sensylate Platform (2024-present):
Built sophisticated AI agent orchestration system with 20+ financial API integrations, generating 100+ institutional-grade analyses. This project demonstrates my ability to architect complex modern systems.

Zixly Business Automation (2024-present):
Currently developing a premium business intelligence platform for Australian SMEs using NextJS 15.5.5, React 19, and PostgreSQL—directly relevant to Resly's tech stack.

Why Return to Team Environment Now:

My independent projects are now live and stable, requiring minimal overhead. Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to put down roots (she has close family here and works as an architect).

I'm actively seeking to:
- Join a great team where I can contribute my 11+ years of experience
- Establish myself in Brisbane's thriving tech industry
- Build meaningful software solutions in a collaborative environment
- Apply my AI-augmented development expertise in a team context

What I Bring:
This period wasn't a gap—it was intensive technical growth. I maintained daily GitHub contributions, mastered modern AI development tools (Claude Code, Cursor), and built production systems. I'm excited to bring this independent technical leadership experience to Resly's small agile team.

================================================================================

QUESTION 5: What interests you about working with Resly?

Three key factors make Resly uniquely compelling:

1. Direct Hospitality Domain Alignment

Your hotel/tourism software mission resonates deeply with my experience. At Oetker Digital (2018-2020), I spent 2+ years building rapid PWA and SPA prototypes specifically for restaurants, hotels, and businesses, including a hotel admin prototype.

I understand the unique challenges of hospitality software:
- Real-time booking and availability management
- Multi-property/multi-user coordination
- Trust accounting and compliance (your Australian regulatory specialization)
- Guest experience and property management workflow balance

This isn't theoretical interest—I've built hospitality management tools with the exact stack you use (React, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL).

2. Perfect Tech Stack Overlap + Growth Opportunity

Your React, NextJS, Node.js, TypeScript stack aligns perfectly with my current skillset:
- NextJS 15.5.5: Actively building Zixly platform (https://github.com/ColeMorton/zixly) with App Router, Prisma, PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- React 19: 9+ years React experience through current projects
- Node.js/TypeScript: 7+ years backend development at Oetker Digital, Panorama Berlin, CrossLend

The GCP/Firebase opportunity excites me—I'm eager to expand beyond Vercel/Supabase into Google Cloud ecosystem.

3. Small Team Innovation Culture

Your emphasis on being a "playground for tech wizards" and "tight-knit crew" matches my best experiences:
- CrossLend: Joined as third developer, thrived in small FinTech team environment
- Independent Projects: Demonstrated self-direction and technical ownership
- 10% Learning Time: Aligns perfectly with my continuous learning approach (daily GitHub contributions, AI-augmented development mastery)

Resly's Unique Position:

Your Airbnb Preferred Software Partner status validates your platform quality, while your Australian market specialization (trust accounting, management rights) shows strategic focus rather than generic solutions. Your remote-first culture and anywhere in Australia flexibility perfectly suits my Brisbane establishment.

What I Want to Contribute:

I'm excited to bring my hotel software experience, modern full-stack expertise, and entrepreneurial mindset to help Resly empower independent hoteliers. Your mission to build businesses for the future through innovation, quality, and community aligns with my values and career goals in Brisbane's tech ecosystem.

================================================================================

QUESTION 6: What is your salary expectation?

OPTION A - Direct & Transparent (RECOMMENDED):

Based on my 11+ years of commercial experience and Brisbane's senior full-stack developer market rates, I'm targeting $120,000-$140,000 depending on the role scope and team structure.

I'm prioritizing finding the right team fit and establishing myself in Brisbane's tech industry, so I'm flexible within appropriate senior developer ranges for a small, innovative company like Resly.

---

OPTION B - Collaborative Discovery:

I'd like to understand Resly's budget range for this role first. For context, senior full-stack developers with 10+ years experience in Brisbane typically earn $110,000-$150,000, with variation based on company size and role expectations.

Given my experience (11+ years, international background, direct hospitality domain expertise) balanced with my market re-entry after independent development, I'm flexible within the senior developer range. What's Resly's target for this position?

---

OPTION C - Conservative Positioning:

Given Resly's startup stage (1-10 employees) and my focus on joining a great team rather than maximizing compensation, I'd be comfortable in the $110,000-$130,000 range for a senior full-stack role.

My priority is contributing to meaningful hospitality technology with a collaborative team in Brisbane, not necessarily top-market rates.
