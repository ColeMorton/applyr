## Dear Codafication Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at Codafication. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission of making the world simpler through elegant digital transformation solutions for Australia's leading insurers and enterprises.

## Great Technical Stack Alignment

Your technology stack requirements match well with my core expertise in **TypeScript, Node.js, React.js, and GraphQL**, with learning opportunities in **Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure**:

- **React**: 8+ years across multiple companies (CrossLend, Market Logic, Panorama Berlin, Oetker Digital) through current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ implementation
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years from Oetker Digital through current development projects including [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **Node.js**: 2+ years backend development including API services and GraphQL implementations

I'm excited to develop deeper expertise in **Kubernetes orchestration, AWS, and Azure cloud infrastructure** as these are foundational technologies for modern DevOps practices.

## Regulated Industry Expertise Perfectly Aligned with InsurTech

Your InsurTech platform serving Australia's top insurers (IAG, Suncorp, Aon, QBE, YOUI) requires engineers who understand compliance and accuracy. My experience spans regulated industries where software precision is critical:

- **FinTech Platform Leadership**: CrossLend - Maintained platform stability and regulatory compliance throughout scaling from 3 to 20+ developers
- **Healthcare Enterprise Systems**: CharmHealth - Built oncology and patient management system for Chris O'Brien Lifehouse where strict regulatory compliance was core to all business logic
- **Financial Systems**: 20+ financial APIs integrated in [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) platform, demonstrating complex system integration capabilities

This regulated industry foundation provides direct experience with the precision requirements in InsurTech software: when processing insurance claims for Australia's largest carriers, accuracy, compliance, and reliability are essential. My experience building life-critical healthcare systems and financial platforms demonstrates the regulatory compliance mindset your team requires.

## Scale-up Experience & Collaborative Engineering

Your growth from startup to 60+ employees serving major enterprise clients resonates with my career trajectory:

- **Team Scaling**: Successfully scaled development teams from 3 to 20+ developers while maintaining regulatory compliance and code quality standards at CrossLend
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Extensive experience working across product, design, and engineering teams in fast-paced environments at Oetker Digital and Market Logic
- **Code Review Culture**: Strong experience participating in regular code reviews and ensuring adherence to best practices across diverse technology stacks
- **Modern Development Practices**: Active GitHub contributor with 28,500+ lines of maintained code demonstrating commitment to code quality and continuous learning

Your emphasis on SCRUM ceremonies, code reviews, and collaborative delivery aligns perfectly with my preferred working style. I thrive in environments where knowledge sharing accelerates team growth and code quality is a collective responsibility.

## Brisbane Establishment & Cultural Alignment

Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to start our new life and put down roots, with close family connections here. As a New Zealand citizen, I have full Australian work rights without visa complications. I'm fully committed to Australia's thriving tech market and immediately available to contribute.

Your Fortitude Valley office location is ideally situated for me, and I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to meet and collaborate with new people in your innovative team environment. Your dedication to learning time each month, career progression, and team celebration culture represents exactly the environment where I do my best work. Having successfully navigated fast-paced environments at Berlin startups and established enterprises, I'm excited to 
contribute to Codafication's continued award-winning success in the Australian InsurTech market.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities through technical discussions or challenges.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
