## Dear Peoplebank Australia QLD Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Developer position you're representing. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your client's next-generation cloud-native People & Payroll platform.

## Strong Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for engineers with expertise in **TypeScript, Node.js, and React** aligns well with my full-stack technology experience spanning web and mobile platforms:

- **React**: 5+ years with specific examples: CrossLend B2B lending, Market Logic data insights, Oetker Digital e-commerce, current Sensylate AI GenContentOps project
- **TypeScript**: 3+ years commercial experience at Oetker Digital and active use in current Sensylate platform development
- **Node.js**: 2+ years backend development including Panorama Berlin fashion show API and Oetker Digital e-commerce services, providing solid foundation for server-side components
- **Mobile Development**: React Native app development (Panorama Berlin) and iOS application development (Advertile Mobile AppBounty), demonstrating cross-platform capability
- **JavaScript**: 11+ years foundation spanning full-stack development from early career to current projects, including Angular and Vue experience

While I haven't worked specifically with AWS microservices in production, my full-stack experience with continuous integration/delivery technologies such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI and Docker provides a strong foundation for quickly mastering cloud-native development practices.

## Scalable Solutions & Collaborative Development

Your emphasis on designing and delivering **scalable, elegant solutions in an Agile team** aligns directly with my documented experience in collaborative development environments:

- **Team Scaling & Knowledge Transfer**: At CrossLend, I contributed to growing the development team from 3 to 20+ developers while maintaining platform stability, requiring continuous knowledge sharing and collaborative problem-solving
- **Modern Development Practices**: Experienced with Test Driven Development, CI/CD, and collaborative code review processes that ensure scalable, maintainable solutions
- **Cross-Platform Architecture**: Built solutions spanning web platforms, mobile applications, and backend services, demonstrating ability to take ownership of complex challenges across different technology stacks
- **Quality-Focused Development**: Maintained system reliability and performance during rapid team expansion, ensuring elegant solutions that scale with organizational growth

## Regulated Industry Experience & Technical Leadership

Having built both financial lending and healthcare compliance systems, I understand the critical importance of **accuracy, reliability, and regulatory adherence** in enterprise software:

- **FinTech Platform Leadership**: CrossLend GmbH - Maintained platform stability and regulatory compliance throughout the scaling process
- **Healthcare Enterprise Systems**: Charm Health - Built oncology and patient management system for the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse, where strict regulatory compliance was a core criterion baked into all business logic

This background in regulated industries translates directly to People & Payroll systems where accuracy and compliance are essential.

## Brisbane Establishment & Immediate Availability

My wife and I relocated to Brisbane to start a new life and put down roots, with close family connections here. I'm fully committed to Australia's thriving tech market and immediately available to contribute to your client's team. As a New Zealand citizen, I have full Australian work rights without any visa complications.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start. Please contact me via phone or email (see below) to arrange an interview (preferably in-person). I'm happy to demonstrate my capabilities through a technical discussion or challenge.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
