JavaScript Foundation: JavaScript: 11+ years with 19 LinkedIn endorsements (highest-endorsed skill) spanning full-stack development

I'm excited to enhance your client's dashboard capabilities, my full-stack architecture experience provides an excellent base for quickly mastering their internal API and building sophisticated data visualization tools.

Professional Approach & Industry Alignment

Your client's need for experienced frontend engineers who can handle both modern React development and legacy maintenance positions me well for their requirements:
Technical Excellence: Adherence to enterprise-grade coding standards demonstrated through 11+ years building production systems for healthcare, fintech, and enterprise clients

My experience spans from building critical healthcare systems for Australian hospitals to scaling fintech platforms from startup to enterprise, providing versatile technical capabilities that appeal to multiple potential employers.

Brisbane Establishment & Immediate Availability

Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to start our new life and put down roots, with close family connections here. As a New Zealand citizen, I have full Australian work rights without visa complications.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities through a technical discussion or code review of my current projects.

Best regards,

Cole Morton
