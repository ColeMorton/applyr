Dear Trilogy Care Hiring Team,

Your job posting caught my attention: "AI isn’t a side project, it’s how we build." This perfectly describes my work over the past year building a quantitative analysis suite, a GenContentOps platform for financial analysis, and personal web-site: colemorton.com.

Having recently relocated to Brisbane from Berlin earlier this year, I'm excited to join a forward-thinking team to deliver high-quality products and solutions. Your King Street office location is perfectly located and a short distance away from my home in Chermside.

Three reasons I'm your ideal candidate:

1. **AI-First Architecture**: I don't just use AI tools - I architect systems where AI orchestration is fundamental to the solution, as demonstrated by Sensylate's sophisticated validation frameworks: https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate

2. **11+ Years Commercial Software Experience**: I have experience across a dozen teams, a myriad of front-end technologies and beyond, a diverse assortment of various products and solutions. Web Development is my backbone with mastery in React and Typescript. I'm highly versatile and adaptable to the needs of the business of stakeholders.  

3. **Entrepreneurial Builder Mindset**: 1,471 GitHub contributions over the last year on a daily basis: https://github.com/ColeMorton
I'm committed to personal growth and developing my skills; software engineering and systems design is my passion.

Looking forward to discussing how my unique blend of AI expertise and genuine passion for meaningful technology can contribute to Trilogy Care's mission.

Cole Morton
