## Dear Anson McCade Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Developer position you're representing. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your client's mission to deliver cutting-edge government contract projects.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for **React, Node.js, TypeScript, and full-stack capabilities** aligns perfectly with my experience:

- **React**: 9+ years across multiple companies (CrossLend, Market Logic, Panorama Berlin, Oetker Digital) through current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ implementation
- **Node.js**: 9+ years backend development including Express.js, Apollo GraphQL, and PostgreSQL integrations
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years from Oetker Digital through current development projects including [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **JavaScript**: 11+ years with **19 LinkedIn endorsements** (highest-endorsed skill) spanning full-stack development
- **Database Systems**: 11+ years including MySQL, SQL Server (8 LinkedIn endorsements), PostgreSQL, and Entity Framework (9 LinkedIn endorsements)

My experience with React Native and CI/CD practices further supports the technical requirements outlined in your job specification.

## Regulated Industry Foundation & Government-Ready Experience

My background in regulated environments positions me well for government contract work:

- **Healthcare Enterprise Systems**: CharmHealth - Built oncology and patient management system for Chris O'Brien Lifehouse where strict regulatory compliance was core to all business logic
- **FinTech Platform Leadership**: CrossLend - Maintained platform stability and regulatory compliance throughout scaling from 3 to 20+ developers
- **Banking Enterprise Client**: Dievision - Lead frontend developer for major German banking client meeting strict industry standards

This regulated industry experience translates directly to government contracts where compliance, accuracy, and security are paramount.

## Professional Approach & Industry Alignment

My professional experience demonstrates the adaptability and collaboration skills essential for successful government project delivery:

- **Technical Excellence**: Daily GitHub commits over the past year, current [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) platform implements sophisticated AI agent orchestration with 20+ financial API integrations
- **Professional Adaptability**: Successfully integrated into diverse team structures across FinTech, HealthTech, and enterprise environments spanning three countries (Australia, Germany, New Zealand)
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Extensive experience working across product, design, and engineering teams in fast-paced environments including seamless cross-team collaboration at Oetker Digital
- **Team Leadership**: Successfully scaled development teams from 3 to 20+ developers while maintaining regulatory compliance and code quality standards at CrossLend FinTech

My ability to work closely with stakeholders and translate priorities into technical delivery aligns well with the collaborative nature of government contract work.

## Brisbane Establishment & Immediate Availability

Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to start our new life and put down roots, with close family connections here. As a New Zealand citizen, I have full Australian work rights without visa complications. I'm fully committed to Australia's thriving tech market and immediately available to contribute.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities through technical assessments or project discussions. I look forward to helping your client deliver successful outcomes on their government contract projects.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
