## Dear Edison Talent Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Developer position you're representing. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your client's mission to transform healthcare clinics through innovative SaaS technology.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your client's requirement for engineers with expertise in **React, React Native, TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, and MySQL** aligns directly with my technology stack:

- **React**: 8+ years within multiple companies: CrossLend, Market Logic, Panorama Berlin, and Oetker Digital to current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ on [colemorton.com](https://colemorton.com)
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years experience from Oetker Digital through current [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **Node.js & GraphQL**: 2.5 years Node.js with GraphQL production experience at Oetker Digital using Apollo GraphQL + Prisma ORM
- **AWS & MySQL**: Extensive cloud deployment experience with 11+ years database expertise including SQL Server (8 LinkedIn endorsements) and Entity Framework (9 LinkedIn endorsements)

Your client's emphasis on **AI/ML integration** aligns with my expertise: my current [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) GenContentOps project implements sophisticated AI agent orchestration with 20+ financial API integrations, demonstrating modern AI-augmented development workflows.

## Healthcare Technology & Regulatory Compliance Expertise

My experience directly aligns with your client's healthcare technology focus:

- **CharmHealth Hospital Systems**: Maintained critical drug list data for multiple Brisbane hospitals including oncology and patient management system for Chris O'Brien Lifehouse at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney
- **Regulatory Compliance Foundation**: Direct experience where strict regulatory compliance was core to all business logic with understanding that software accuracy impacts patient outcomes

This healthcare foundation, combined with CrossLend FinTech regulatory experience, provides proven understanding of compliance-critical software development in regulated industries.

## Proven Team Collaboration Experience

- **Team Scaling Leadership**: At CrossLend, I was the third developer hired and helped grow the team from 3 to 20+ developers.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Oetker Digital experience working across many teams in fast-paced adaptive environments with product owners, designers, backend developers, and more in the loop

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start. Please contact me via 041 558 3331 or cole.morton@hotmail.com to arrange an interview (preferably in-person). I'm happy to demonstrate my capabilities through a technical discussion or challenge.
