## Dear iSelect Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer position at iSelect. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission of helping millions of Australians find the right financial and household products through trusted comparison services.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for **JavaScript (React) and Node.js** aligns perfectly with my experience:

- **JavaScript**: 11+ years with **19 LinkedIn endorsements** (highest-endorsed skill) spanning full-stack development

- **TypeScript**: 6+ years from Oetker Digital through current development projects including [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **AI Integration**: Current [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) GenContentOps project implements sophisticated AI agent orchestration with 20+ financial API integrations

While I'm excited to develop my **AWS cloud expertise**, my **strong foundation in modern JavaScript ecosystems** provides an excellent base for quickly mastering your technology stack.

## Regulated Industry Expertise

Your emphasis on **regulated industries experience** resonates strongly with my background:

- **Healthcare Enterprise Systems**: CharmHealth - Built oncology and patient management system for Chris O'Brien Lifehouse where strict regulatory compliance was core to all business logic
- **FinTech Platform Leadership**: CrossLend - Maintained platform stability and regulatory compliance throughout scaling from 3 to 20+ developers
- **Financial API Integration**: 20+ financial APIs integrated in [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) platform, demonstrating complex system integration capabilities

This combination of healthcare and financial services regulatory experience positions me well for iSelect's comparison platform requirements.

## Team Leadership & Scaling Experience

Your emphasis on **mentoring and technical leadership** aligns with my proven experience. At **CrossLend**, I successfully scaled development teams from 3 to 20+ developers while maintaining regulatory compliance and code quality standards, including:

- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Led frontend project for major German banking client at Dievision, translating technical requirements into business-friendly solutions
- **Mentoring Excellence**: Demonstrated ability to guide junior engineers while maintaining high technical standards and implementing TDD practices

## Cultural Alignment & Innovation Holdings Synergy

Your **Innovation Holdings backing** and **Compare the Market relationship** creates exciting synergy opportunities:

- **Drive**: My [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) platform demonstrates continuous innovation with sophisticated AI agent orchestration and automated content generation
- **All Together**: Cross-functional collaboration experience at Oetker Digital and team scaling success at CrossLend demonstrates collaborative DNA

## Brisbane Establishment & Immediate Availability

Earlier this year, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to start our new life and put down roots, with close family connections here. As a New Zealand citizen, I have full Australian work rights without visa complications.

I'm fully committed to Australia's thriving tech market and immediately available to contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm happy to demonstrate my capabilities through a technical discussion or code review session.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
