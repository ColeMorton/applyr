## Dear FSoft Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Web Developer position at FSoft. As a full-stack engineer with **11+ years of commercial experience** and deep expertise in financial systems, I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to Biz Core's mission of simplifying payment processing and loan management for Australian businesses.

**Why I'm an Exceptional Match for FSoft**

Your requirement for a developer who can "design, build and ship features end-to-end" aligns perfectly with the vast majority of my commercial experience across both startups and a startup incubator. I've been passionate about finance for **10 years** since my fintech position at CrossLend and have spent the past four years building sophisticated financial analysis and trading systems, giving me intimate knowledge of multi-source financial data integration with institutional-grade accuracy.

**Relevant Technical & Domain Experience**

My career has progressively built toward the exact intersection of skills FSoft needs:

**Financial Systems Architecture** (2021-2025):
- Built [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) GenContentOps project, integrating **18+ financial and economic APIs**
- Built Quantitative Analysis suite of tools for the development and testing of trading strategies and portfolio management.

**Enterprise Software Development** (2013-2020):
- At **CrossLend GmbH** (Berlin fintech), developed frontend and managed dashboards for a business-to-business lending platform
- At **Charm Health**, developed a Hospital Pharmacy Management system using Silverlight, **.NET/C#**, Entity Framework, and SQL Server
- Consistently worked with **multi-tenant SaaS architectures** requiring data isolation and performance at scale

**Full-Stack Expertise**:
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: 12+ years since 2013 
- **Angular.js**: 4 years over 3 positions
- **C#/.NET**: Foundation from **Diploma Major: MCAD C#/.NET** and 3 years commercial experience.
- **API Design**: RESTful services, webhook handling, WCF services.

**What I Bring to FSoft Beyond Code**

Having built both financial lending user interfaces and analysis tools, I understand the critical importance of **accuracy, precision and performance** in financial software.

I'm particularly excited by FSoft's pragmatic approach to AI tool adoption. I've been using Claude Code, and Open Router daily for the past years as force multipliers in my development workflow, maintaining the "strong verification habits" your job posting emphasizes. This aligns perfectly with my philosophy of leveraging AI to maintain consistency, and to enforce convention within rigorous quality standards.

**Commitment to Brisbane and FSoft's Growth**

After 12 years establishing myself in Berlin's tech scene, my wife and I relocated to Brisbane to be closer to family. We're putting down roots here, she's working as an architect while I'm eager to contribute to Queensland's thriving fintech ecosystem.

I'm drawn to FSoft specifically because:
- **Domain Alignment**: Fintech + lending combination leverages my exact expertise
- **Technical Challenge**: Financial SaaS at scale is an exciting prospect
- **Growth Stage**: Fast-growing with established products; I can make a meaningful impact

**Next Steps**

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of software engineering excellence and financial domain experience could accelerate Biz Core's growth. I'm particularly interested in learning about your roadmap for payment gateway expansions, loan product variations, and how you're approaching the evolving Australian regulatory landscape.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm confident that my experience building production financial systems, combined with my commitment to Brisbane and passion for fintech innovation, makes me an ideal addition to your team.

Best regards,  
Cole Morton

**Note:** I'm available for immediate start and would be happy to demonstrate my capabilities through a technical discussion or building a sample Angular component that integrates with financial APIs. I can also provide detailed architectural diagrams of my financial systems integration work if helpful.
