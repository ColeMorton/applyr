## Dear Moonward Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Frontend Developer position at Moonward. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission of building the future through mission-critical digital products at a global scale.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for **React and TypeScript experience** aligns perfectly with my expertise:

- **React**: 8+ years within multiple companies: CrossLend, Market Logic, Panorama Berlin, and Oetker Digital to current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ on [colemorton.com](https://colemorton.com)
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years experience from Oetker Digital through current [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **Git fundamentals**: 11+ years professional usage across [GitHub](https://github.com/colemorton) and GitLab
- **Agile/Scrum Methodologies**: 6 years experience as primary development workflow across multiple companies with several LinkedIn endorsements.
- **Early Adoption Leadership**: August 2024-present intensive AI-augmented development experience with Open Router, Cursor and Claude Code.

Two-week sprints are most familiar, in addition to shorter periods. My foundation in enterprise-grade development provides an excellent base for quickly adapting to your DevignTM methodology.

## Proven Team Collaboration & Boutique Excellence

My experience aligns perfectly with Moonward's intentionally boutique approach:

- **Team Scaling Leadership**: At CrossLend, I was the third developer hired and helped grow the team from 3 to 20+ developers.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Oetker Digital experience working across many teams in fast-paced adaptive environments with product owners, designers, backend developers, and more in the loop
- **Code Quality Craftsmanship**: Maintained regulatory compliance standards during rapid scaling, ensuring every line of code reflected enterprise standards

This experience positions me to contribute immediately to your scrum product teams.

## AI/ML Technology Alignment (Bonus Skill)

Your interest in AI/ML technologies aligns with my recent technical evolution:

- **Current AI Integration**: Built GenContentOps AI agent orchestration project in [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) powered by Anthropic Claude.
- **Fullstack Exposure**: Python 3.10, Node.js Express/GraphQL, and historical .NET experience providing backend development understanding
  
This positions me to contribute immediately to your growing AI service portfolio.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start. Please contact me via 041 558 3331 or [colemorton.com](https://colemorton.com) to arrange an interview (preferably in-person). I'm happy to demonstrate my capabilities through a technical discussion or challenge.
