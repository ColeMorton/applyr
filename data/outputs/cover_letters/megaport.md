## Dear Megaport Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Software Engineer position at Megaport. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to the world's leading Network as a Service platform and help build the software that powers global connectivity for 2,800+ enterprise customers.

## Strong Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for engineers with **Vue, Nuxt, or other modern frameworks like Angular or React** combined with **TypeScript** aligns well with my experience:

- **React**: 8+ years across multiple companies (CrossLend, Market Logic, Panorama Berlin, Oetker Digital) through current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ implementation
- **Vue.js**: 2.5 years experience at Oetker Digital including component-based architecture and state management patterns
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years from Oetker Digital through current development projects including [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **JavaScript**: 11+ years with **19 LinkedIn endorsements** (highest-endorsed skill) spanning full-stack development

While I'll be adapting from React and Vue 2.x to your **Vue 3, Vite, and TanStack** stack, my foundation in **TypeScript, component architecture, responsive design, and web standards** provides an excellent base for quickly mastering your specific toolchain. My testing experience with **Cypress and Jest** translates directly to **Playwright and Vitest** testing philosophies.

## Enterprise Experience & Scalable Systems

Your position supporting the **Megaport Portal** aligns strongly with my enterprise systems background:

- **FinTech Platform Leadership**: CrossLend - Maintained platform stability and regulatory compliance throughout scaling from 3 to 20+ developers
- **Healthcare Enterprise Systems**: CharmHealth - Built oncology and patient management system for Chris O'Brien Lifehouse where strict regulatory compliance was core to all business logic
- **Enterprise Client Experience**: Served as lead frontend developer and first-contact for major German bank client, demonstrating ability to clearly understand business requirements and translate complexe engineering concepts.

## Cultural Alignment & Team Collaboration

Your emphasis on "**collaboration beats hierarchy, curiosity fuels growth, everyone's voice matters**" strongly resonates with my professional values and experience:

- **Cross-Functional Teams**: Extensive experience working across product, design, and engineering teams in fast-paced environments
- **Team Leadership**: Successfully scaled development teams from 3 to 20+ developers while maintaining regulatory compliance and code quality standards
- **Curiosity & Continuous Learning**: Recent [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) platform development and active GitHub contributions demonstrate commitment to technical evolution

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start. Please contact me via 041 558 3331 or cole.morton@hotmail.com to arrange an interview (preferably in-person). I'm happy to demonstrate my capabilities through a technical discussion or challenge.
