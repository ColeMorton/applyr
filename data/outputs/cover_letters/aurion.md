## Why Aurion

Three factors make this role particularly appealing:

1. **Domain Alignment**: My fintech experience at CrossLend taught me the criticality of accuracy when handling financial dataâ€”directly applicable to payroll
2. **Technical Match**: Your People & Payroll platform architecture parallels my recent platform development work
3. **Brisbane Focus**: My wife and I have been planning to move to Brisbane since 2018 to be closer to her family and mine (I'm Kiwi).
Aurion's 40-year Brisbane heritage aligns with our commitment to put down our roots here.

**Immediate Contributions**:
