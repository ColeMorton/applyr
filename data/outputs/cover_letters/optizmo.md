## Dear Optizmo Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Mid-Level Engineers position at Optizmo. As a full-stack developer with 11+ years of enterprise experience recently established in Brisbane, I'm excited by the opportunity to contribute to your thriving remote-first SaaS platform while learning from your exceptional cross-functional teams.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your Node/React/TypeScript stack aligns seamlessly with my extensive experience:

- **React**: 10 years since early adoption at CrossLend (2015) through current React 19 implementation in my Sensylate DevContentOps platform
- **Node.js & TypeScript**: Extensive Node.js backend development including Express.js, Apollo GraphQL, and RESTful APIs.
- **Modern AI Development**: Leveraging Claude and Cursor (as listed in your tech requirements) to dramatically improve consistency, code-coverage, code-quality, documentation, automation, and compliance while maintaining hands-on coding practices.
- **Claude Code**: Daily Claude user 1+ years and Claude Code from first release. Mastery in Claude Code including AI orchestration and agentic workflows as demonstrated in [sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) DevContentOps.

While I'm eager to expand into Go, my backend foundation in Node.js and background in .NET/C# provides an excellent base for quickly adopting your full technology stack.

## Fresh Perspective with Modern Practices

I'm enthusiastic about returning to collaborative team development:

- **Modern development practices** with AI-augmented workflows, actively laying the groundwork for cross-functional development practices in the age of AI.
- **Systems Design thinking** from deep experience in all phases of SDLC and building complex systems from conception to production
- **Growth mindset** with genuine excitement for learning new technologies, infrastructure as code, and BDD practices within your team structure

My recent focus on independent development has kept me current with modern practices while maintaining the collaborative leadership skills demonstrated in my previous team environments.

## Regulatory & High-Scale Experience

My background aligns perfectly with Optizmo's Fortune 500 client focus:

- **Healthcare Compliance**: Built an oncology system for Chris O'Brien Lifehouse while at CharmHealth, containing critical regulatory requirements and zero-downtime expectations
- **FinTech Scaling**: Led frontend development during CrossLend's rapid growth phase, maintaining platform stability while scaling the development team from 3 to 20+ developers

Understanding Optizmo's position as a leader in email compliance automation, I'm particularly drawn to joining a team that demonstrates leadership in innovation towards compliance requirements for enterprises.

## Remote-First Cultural Match

Your remote-first culture resonates with my experience:

- **International remote collaboration** between Germany and New Zealand, and within Europe, proving effective cross-timezone teamwork
- **Recently established in Brisbane** with family connections both in Brisbane and New Zealand, providing long-term stability for your Australian operations
- **Cross-functional team leadership** my role at Oetker Digital demonstrates my proven ability to thrive in flat organizational structures where flexibility and dynamism is key.

I'm excited by Optizmo's expansion into Brisbane and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your Australian market growth while working within your established remote-first framework.

## Brisbane Commitment & Immediate Availability

Having recently put down roots in Brisbane, I'm fully committed to establishing myself in Australia's thriving tech market. I'm immediately available to contribute to your cross-functional agile teams and excited to become a key leader and contributor within Optizmo.

Your company's combination of technical excellence, enterprise client validation, and genuine commitment to employee growth creates exactly the environment where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to develop cutting-edge skills.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my enterprise experience, modern development practices, and enthusiasm for collaborative growth can contribute to Optizmo's continued success.

Thank you for your consideration.
