Dear Squiz Hiring Team,

I can see that you're rapidly expanding the DXP team, and seeking people proficient in Node, TypeScript, React, Git and CI/CD.
This stack is my bread-and-butter, representing my deepest experience and greatest strengths.

Having recently relocated to Brisbane from Berlin earlier this year, I'm excited to join a forward-thinking team to deliver high-quality products and solutions.

Over the past year I've built a quantitative analysis suite, and a GenContentOps platform for financial analysis, and personal web-site (TypeScript+React.js): www.colemorton.com.

With 11+ Years Commercial Software Experience, I have experience across a dozen teams utilzing agile and scrum, a myriad of front-end technologies and beyond, a diverse assortment of various products and solutions driven by user stories and acceptance criteria. Web Development is my backbone with mastery in React and Typescript. I'm highly versatile and adaptable to the needs of the business of stakeholders.

I have an entrepreneurial buidler mindset with ddaily Github contributions over the last year: https://github.com/ColeMorton
I'm committed to personal growth and developing my skills; software engineering is my passion.

Looking forward to discussing this role and how I can contribute to DXP.

Cole Morton
