# Dear Just Digital People Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior FullStack Engineer / Founding Engineer position you're representing. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your client's mission to revolutionize the creator economy.

## Perfect Technical Stack Alignment

Your requirement for **React Native / React / TypeScript / NodeJS** aligns directly with my experience:

- **React**: 8+ years across multiple companies (CrossLend, Market Logic, Panorama Berlin, Oetker Digital) through current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ implementation
- **React Native**: Built production QR scanning mobile app at Panorama Berlin serving fashion show events
- **TypeScript**: 6+ years from Oetker Digital through current development projects including [personal website](https://colemorton.com)
- **Node.js**: 2+ years backend development including API services and GraphQL implementations

While I'm excited to develop expertise in AWS/GCP cloud platforms, my **Node.js + React foundation** provides an excellent base for quickly mastering modern cloud-native development practices.

## Proven Founding Team Experience

Your client's emphasis on joining as a crucial first development team member resonates with my background:

- **CrossLend FinTech Platform**: Joined as the third developer and grew the development team from 3 to over 20 while maintaining platform stability and regulatory compliance
- **Technical Leadership**: Direct experience making architectural decisions and technical direction in early-stage environments
- **Startup Mentality**: From Crosslend to Advertile Mobile and Oetker Digital (start-up incubator), I have years of experience at all levels of the product life cycle and love to face challenges head-on.
- **Content Creation** Current GenContentOps project [Sensylate](https://github.com/ColeMorton/sensylate) demonstrates AI-powered content generation pipelines and represents an entrepreneurial technical approach

## Professional Approach & Industry Alignment

My experience in regulated industries positions me well for your client's requirements:

- **Technical Excellence**: Proven ability to deliver production systems in healthcare (CharmHealth oncology systems) and FinTech (CrossLend lending platform) environments
- **Professional Adaptability**: Successfully integrated into diverse team structures across international startup and enterprise environments
- **Industry Understanding**: **11+ years** building user-facing applications with modern practices and AI-augmented development approach

Brisbane establishment with immediate availability and full Australian work rights.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities through technical discussions or code review.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
