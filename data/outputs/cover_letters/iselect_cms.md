## Dear iSelect Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer (CMS) position at iSelect. As a Brisbane-based full-stack developer with **11+ years of commercial experience**, I'm excited to contribute to your mission of helping Australians compare and save through modern web technologies and content platforms.

## JavaScript & React Expertise with Learning Commitment

Your requirements for **JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS** align directly with my core expertise:

- **JavaScript**: 11+ years with 19 LinkedIn endorsements, from .NET enterprise foundations to modern React/TypeScript stacks
- **React**: 8+ years from first exposure at CrossLend FinTech (2015) to current React 19 with Astro 5.12+ on [colemorton.com](https://colemorton.com)
- **HTML & CSS**: Deep expertise with modern CSS architectures including styled-components, SASS, and TailwindCSS
- **Jenkins CI/CD**: 5+ years maintaining continuous integration pipelines with automated testing and deployment workflows.

While I haven't worked with traditional CMS platforms like WordPress or Drupal, I've demonstrated rapid technology adoption throughout my career. I mastered React Native in 4 months to deliver production apps, and transitioned from zero AI experience to building enterprise agentic systems within 1 month. This proven learning velocity gives me confidence in quickly mastering your CMS stack.

## Content Systems & Healthcare Compliance Experience

My experience building content-driven systems in regulated industries aligns with iSelect's needs:

- **Healthcare Systems Engineering**: Built oncology and patient management system for the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with strict regulatory compliance
- **API-Driven Content Architecture**: Integrated 20+ financial APIs building content generation systems for automated analysis and reporting
- **Database Content Management**: Architected SQL Server-based content systems handling critical healthcare data with audit trails
- **Modern Content Platforms**: Currently developing AI-driven content generation producing 100+ automated analysis pieces

This foundation in building secure, compliant systems translates directly to managing content platforms serving millions of Australians.

## Team Collaboration & Independent Positioning Value

Your emphasis on supporting content creators and marketers resonates with my collaborative approach:

- **Cross-Functional Delivery**: Worked across multiple teams at Oetker Digital delivering rapid prototypes for hospitality clients
- **Team Scaling Experience**: Grew development team from 3 to 20+ engineers while maintaining platform stability at CrossLend
- **Technical Mentorship**: Guided junior developers on React patterns, code quality, and architectural decisions

## Brisbane Establishment & Compare the Market Synergies

Having relocated to Brisbane earlier this year with my wife to be closer to family and put down roots, I'm fully committed to the Queensland tech ecosystem. My New Zealand citizenship provides full work rights with no sponsorship requirements, and I'm available for immediate start.

I'm particularly interested in how iSelect and Compare the Market can leverage shared technology infrastructure while maintaining distinct value propositions. My experience with multi-brand platforms could contribute to maximizing synergies while preserving each brand's unique identity.

## Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my combination of:

- **JavaScript/React expertise**: 11+ years JavaScript, 8+ years React production experience
- **Rapid learning capability**: Proven 4-6 month technology mastery cycles
- **Regulated industry experience**: Healthcare and financial services compliance
- **Immediate Brisbane availability**: Full work rights and permanant residence

...can contribute to iSelect's CMS platform evolution and support your team's mission of helping Australians make better financial decisions.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm available for immediate start and happy to demonstrate my capabilities through technical assessment or trial project.

Best regards,

**Cole Morton**
