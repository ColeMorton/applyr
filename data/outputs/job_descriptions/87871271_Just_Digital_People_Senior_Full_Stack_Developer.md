About the Company

Join a leading Australian brand at the forefront of digital transformation in the financial services space. This organisation powers millions of customer interactions across lending, insurance, and household finance products. You'll be part of a well-established tech team contributing to a greenfield environment as they continue to modernise platforms, enhance user experience, and scale their offering nationally.

About the Role

We're looking for a skilled Senior Full Stack Developer to join a forward-thinking and collaborative team within a well-established financial services organisation. In this role, you'll play a key part in designing, developing, and delivering scalable, secure, and reliable digital products and services using Node, React, Typescript and AWS.

You'll be working primarily on greenfield projects, with around 80% of your time focused on new feature development across products such as home loans, mortgages, and digital lending tools. These projects can range from building solutions to reduce interest rates in real-time, to supporting first home buyer incentives and other end-to-end lending experiences.

As a Senior Developer you'll also be able to provide technical guidance, influence decisions on technology stack, design patterns, and architectural strategies.

You'll work closely with a tight-knit Agile team including developers, testers, and a delivery lead, participating in 2-week sprint cycles to deliver high-quality, scalable solutions.

This is a fantastic opportunity for someone who enjoys problem solving, working across modern tech stacks, and building impactful products in a fast-paced environment.
