Emanate Technology have partnered with a long standing institution in Brisbane who are looking to bolster their Software Development team with additional knowledge and experience. The structure is relatively flat in this environment, so the role requires strong technical acumen as well as the ability to communicate and collaborate in and multidisciplinary team.

Having been around as long as they have been, there is still some legacy technology, as well as a strong learn towards more modern approaches. Whoever joins this team will need to have had some exposure to WPF - but not be married to it. Web based applications are where things will go in time, but in the meantime you'll need to be able to operate in both worlds.

This team is focused on the development of applications, primarily using modern technology, with developer led testing performed along the way. The methodology in this team is an ever evolving wagile approach requiring the ability to work towards scheduled deployments as well as the flexibility to finesse and fine tune.

Tech Stack:

C#

.Net

Angular (React or Vue exp is considered)

WPF

SQL

Azure (or AWS)

This team work in a hybrid model out of a

Brisbane CBD

office, so you'll need to be able to commit to this.

Full working rights for Australia are required for this position.
