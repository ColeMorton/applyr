About Megaport

We’re not your typical tech company – and we don’t want to be. Megaport is the global leader in Network as a Service (NaaS), and has transformed the way businesses connect to the cloud, data centers, and each other. We’re publicly listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and partnered with the biggest names in tech like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM, and more. Headquartered in Brisbane with a crew of over 350 people spread across Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Americas, our employees enjoy an environment that is collaborative, supportive, and (actually) fun.

Our Team Culture

We’re a team of problem solvers, pixel pushers, code slingers, and cloud fanatics. Culture is more than a poster on the wall here – collaboration beats hierarchy, curiosity fuels our growth, and everyone’s voice matters. We take our work seriously, but not ourselves. We work across time zones to execute on our global vision, trust each other to get things done, and never compromise our values for commercial gain. Most importantly, we place our customers at the center of everything we do.

The Role

We’re looking for a Frontend Developer to join our Engineering team and help us build better, smarter, faster. You’ll play a key role in delivering high-quality software that powers our customers’ experience and streamlines how we work internally.

Reporting directly to the Frontend Development Manager, this role will be a cornerstone contributor to our most valuable web property - the Megaport Portal - along with other critical internal and customer-facing applications.

You’ll join a highly skilled and driven technical team that thrives on collaboration and innovation. Together with stakeholders across the business, you’ll create solutions that don’t just meet expectations - they set new ones.

What You'll Be Doing

Build and maintain internal and customer-facing web applications, including the Megaport Portal.

Use modern tools like Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, TanStack, and NX Monorepo to deliver new features and improvements.

Write clean, scalable, and maintainable code while meeting delivery goals.

Collaborate with engineers and stakeholders to design intuitive, high-performing solutions.

Implement and refine code architectures, processes, and best practices.

Develop tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) using tools like Playwright and Vitest.

Keep learning and growing your knowledge of design principles and maintainable architecture.

What We Are Looking For

A proven track record of building high-performance, high-quality software, ideally with Vue, Nuxt, or other modern frameworks like Angular or React.

Strong understanding of web standards and guidelines — accessibility, semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript APIs, internationalization — you care about getting it right for all users.

Experience consuming and integrating web services.

Hands-on experience building responsive applications that work beautifully across devices.

An agile mindset — transparent, adaptable, and collaborative.

A strong team player: reliable, flexible, committed, and always ready to share knowledge, solve problems, and support others with respect.

What We Offer

Flexible working environment – a remote-first culture with coworking options available

Generous leave plans – including, parental leave, birthday leave, and a purchased annual leave program

Health and wellness support – through a wellness allowance and employee wellbeing initiatives

Comprehensive learning support – generous study and training allowance plus paid study leave

Creative, modern workspaces – designed to inspire when you're not working remotely, plus access to coworking spaces via our global WeWork membership if you work remotely, but like to get out of the house sometimes

Motivated, inclusive team – work alongside industry experts and fresh talent

Recognition programs – celebrate achievements with our Legend and Kudos award
