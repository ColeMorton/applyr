About us

At Five Good Friends, our mission is clear: to help people live well at home. We’re a tech-enabled services business, and digital products are central to how we deliver for our members (clients), their families, and our care workers.

About the Role

An exciting opportunity to make a real impact as both a builder and a shaper. As our

Full Stack Software Engineer

, you’ll join a small, proven team and extend its capability with your expertise. You’ll work across our ecosystem of third-party platforms and in-house applications to deliver apps, tools, integrations, and experiences that matter.

In this role, you’ll design, build, and run solutions end-to-end, while also helping to strengthen our engineering practices — influencing technology choices, introducing better ways of working, and mentoring colleagues as our capability grows.

The core responsibilities of the role include:

Design, build, and maintain applications, integrations, and tools across our ecosystem of platforms.

Develop solutions ranging from lightweight internal apps to larger member-facing products.

Be capable of owning the full solution lifecycle — from discovery and design to deployment, monitoring, and support.

Help our product and technical leadership to strengthen engineering practices with improvements to version control, CI/CD, testing, reviews, and observability.

Contribute to technology choices across frameworks, cloud platforms, and AI-assisted development tools.

Mentor colleagues and share knowledge to build sustainable in-house capability.

Collaborate with product, design, and service teams to deliver practical, user-centred solutions.

Be forward-thinking in how AI-assisted tooling can help accelerate our delivery and enhance productivity.

Seek opportunities to innovate and deliver better outcomes for members, families, and care workers.

Do you have what it takes?

You’re a pragmatic engineer with experience in full stack delivery teams, and you know what ‘good’ looks like and can help us mature our own capabilities towards that standard. You thrive in small, agile teams where your work has outsized impact, and you’re motivated by building software that improves people’s lives.

Proven experience (3-5 years) as a Full Stack Engineer or in a similar role.

Practical experience with cloud platforms (preferably AWS or Azure).

Familiarity with DevOps practices: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and deployment.

Interest or experience in spec-driven development using frameworks such as BMAD or Github Spec Kit.

Experienced in using AI-assisted development tools (e.g., Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Azure ML,), with the ability to critically evaluate and refine AI-generated outputs.

Awareness of responsible and ethical AI use, particularly in care-focused or trust-based systems.

Excellent problem-solving skills and sound judgment in complex environments.

Strong communication and collaboration skills across disciplines.

Experience in government, healthcare, or community services (desirable but not essential).

Values that naturally align with Five Good Friends’ values and mission.
