Who We Are

iSelect and Compare the Market are trusted, well-known brands dedicated to helping millions of Australians compare and buy personal finance and household products such as insurance, energy, and loans. Together, we provide a seamless, customer-focused experience that makes it easier for Australians to find the right products to suit their needs.

What You’ll Be Doing

Don’t just ship code, shape the way we build software. This role is about more than writing great functions (though you’ll do plenty of that) - it’s about influencing architecture, mentoring teammates and driving the technical decisions that keep our systems smart, secure and scalable.

We’re big on modern practices and we hold ourselves to high standards, but we keep things practical. No endless process for the sake of process. Just solid engineering, delivered well. From AI and multi-agent systems to AWS, Java 21, CI/CD, Playwright and MCP, chances are it’s already in our stack.

What you’ll own:

Designing and delivering digital products that can handle real-world scale and complexity

Setting the standard for clean, testable, future-proof code (and helping others level up)

Making big calls on tech stack, patterns, and architecture while keeping security and reliability front of mind

Championing DevSecOps, automation, and CI/CD so the team spend less time firefighting, more time innovating

Collaborating with product, project, and architecture teams to turn technical magic into business outcomes

Mentoring junior engineers and sharing your hard-earned wisdom (yes, even the mistakes)

What’s In It For You

At Compare the Market and iSelect, we’re all about helping people make smart choices – and joining us might just be yours. We offer an environment where your ideas are heard, your contributions are valued, and your growth genuinely matters. Collaboration is part of our DNA, and you’ll be joining a supportive, forward-thinking team where you can do meaningful work (and be recognised for it!)

We’re guided by three shared values that shape how we work, how we treat each other, and how we show up for our customers - Drive, Noble Intent and All Together.

Plus, we offer a range of great perks to help you thrive both in and out of work:

Vibrant and social community who have annual celebrations, family fun days and regular events

Enjoy flexible work arrangements, including the option of one day working from home each week or a 9-day fortnight

Enjoy additional leave days - ‘ME’ leave and ‘Volunteer Day’ leave

Employee discounts on car and home and contents insurance

Income protection insurance provided to support you in the event of non-work-related illness or injury

What Sets You Apart

If you love solving big problems with clean code, enjoy influencing tech strategy and want to work somewhere that values continuous learning and improvement, this is your spot.

5+ years of full-stack engineering experience

Strong skills in JavaScript (React) and/or Java, with Node.js in your toolkit

AWS wizardry, especially serverless and event-driven architectures

A solid grip on CI/CD, observability, and end-to-end delivery

Bonus points if you’ve wrangled software in regulated industries or hybrid delivery models
