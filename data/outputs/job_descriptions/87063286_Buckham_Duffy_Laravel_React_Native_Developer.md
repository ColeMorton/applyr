Buckham & Duffy

is a Brisbane-based technology firm that delivers ICT programs and bespoke software platforms to government, enterprise and NGOs across the Asia Pacific region. As a company, we focus on driving value for our customers by building custom solutions to solve customer-specific problems.

As developers, we do more than build from a backlog - we critically evaluate business processes and provide advice, alternatives, and novel solutions. Our stack is mainly Laravel and Vue with some React Native apps where necessary.

This role is based in Brisbane (office on Queen Street in the CBD).

Key Responsibilities

Build and maintain features within a React Native (using Expo.dev) application

Design, develop and maintain robust, scalable and secure Laravel-based (with Vue/React) web applications.

Write clean, well-documented code that adheres to industry best practices.

Participate in code reviews, testing and deployment processes.

What We're Looking For

2+ years of hands-on experience in React or React Native

Strong understanding of RESTful APIs

Familiarity with relational databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Experience with version control systems like Git.

Passion for writing clean, efficient and maintainable code.

A self-driven personality with the ability to deliver autonomously.

A mindset that seeks to understand the core business requirements before diving into the code â€“ we like to help our clients find

better

ways of doing things rather than just making their existing processes digital.

Essential skills required:

Vue or React (React Native experience desirable but if you've just done React we can make it work)

Expo.dev ecosystem

Typescript

Tailwind

Git

Desirable skills

Laravel/Vue

Basic Linux knowledge
