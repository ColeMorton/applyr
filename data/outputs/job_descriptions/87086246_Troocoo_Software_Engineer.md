Are you passionate about solving real-world problems with clean, scalable code? Do you enjoy having a voice in technical decisions and working in a collaborative, forward-thinking environment? If so, this role could be your next big move.

About the Role

Weâ€™re seeking a Software Engineer who thrives in modern engineering environments and enjoys contributing ideas as much as writing code. In this role, youâ€™ll be involved in designing, developing, and delivering secure and scalable applications that directly improve customer experiences.

Your day-to-day will include:

Building high-quality software using clean code principles and industry best practices

Contributing to architectural discussions, design patterns, and technology choices

Working in agile squads with product owners, testers, and architects to bring concepts to life

Leveraging modern practices such as cloud-first development, CI/CD, automation, and event-driven design

Exploring and sharing new tools, techniques, and approaches to continuously raise the bar

Whatâ€™s on Offer

This opportunity provides more than just interesting work â€“ itâ€™s a chance to join a team where your ideas are valued and your growth matters. Youâ€™ll enjoy a supportive workplace that encourages learning, collaboration, and innovation, along with a range of employee benefits designed to support both your career and personal life, such as:

Flexible working arrangements (including hybrid options)

Opportunities for professional growth and development

A collaborative culture with regular social and team-building events

Additional leave entitlements to support wellbeing and work-life balance

About You

Weâ€™re looking for someone who enjoys working with modern technologies and can bring fresh ideas to the table. Ideally, youâ€™ll have:

3+ years of software development experience across the full stack

Strong skills in JavaScript (React) and/or Java, with exposure to Node.js

Hands-on experience with cloud platforms (AWS preferred), particularly in serverless or event-driven architectures

Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, observability, and end-to-end software delivery practices

A collaborative mindset and the ability to explain technical concepts in plain language

Experience in regulated industries or hybrid delivery environments will be highly regarded but isnâ€™t essential.

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™re ready to join a dynamic environment where your technical expertise can make a real difference, weâ€™d love to hear from you. Apply today! feel free to reach out for a confidential conversation -
