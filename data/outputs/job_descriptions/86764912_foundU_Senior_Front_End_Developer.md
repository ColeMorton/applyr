We've created a platform that streamlines recruitment, onboarding, rostering, timesheet management, payroll, and reporting for a seamless experience. We’re in the business of building things most people haven’t thought of yet. The pace is fast, and the work is challenging. We dream big, and we fight hard for customer ease.

About the Role

As a Senior Front-End Developer, you will play a crucial role in the Engineering Team, elevating the capability of foundU's library of components and driving innovation in our solutions.

Do you have the foundU DNA?

Creating a product that helps so many businesses get pay right for their employees is pretty special and it’s not something we take for granted.

Our people come from all walks of life -but the one thing that binds us is a glass-half-full, sleeves rolled up, can-do mentality. At foundU, you’ll hear a lot of laughs, a fair share of banter, and the odd noisy debate as we nut out the best ways to adapt to whatever a new workplace law throws at us!

We are looking for someone who has:

Proven track record of designing and delivering successful software projects, showcasing architectural and problem-solving skills.

Proficiency in the foundU tech stack: Laravel, PHP, MySQL, RESTful APIs

Strong understanding of software development principles, design patterns, and best practices.

Ability to develop unit testing of code components or complete applications.

Experience with sprint methodologies and a collaborative team-oriented approach.

Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to convey complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Knowledge of Australian HR/Payroll is advantageous

Demonstrated leadership capabilities and a desire to mentor and elevate team members.

You’ll get bonus points if you have:

A background in payroll, human resources, or SaaS cloud technology
