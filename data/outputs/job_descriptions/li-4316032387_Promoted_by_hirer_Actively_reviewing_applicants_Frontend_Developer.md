• Reviewing software bug reports and highlighting problem areas.

• Maintaining the dashboards frontend (may be exposed to some AngularJS)

Requirements:

• Minimum 4-5 years Front-end Experience

• Minimum 2-3+ years React experience

• You’re comfortable working in legacy front-end code, as it gets phased out from

the business
