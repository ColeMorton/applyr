At Forwood Safety, we’re on a mission to make every shift safer and every workplace fatality-free. We’re seeking a

Software Engineer

who can combine strong engineering skills with AI-assisted development to deliver high-quality software at speed.

Deliver Life-Saving Software

Ship high-impact features across our

React/Remix + TypeScript front end

and

NestJS/AWS microservices back end

—building tools that directly help safety teams spot and eliminate critical risks before they turn deadly.

Work Smarter with AI

Use tools like

Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI copilots

as part of your daily workflow to accelerate delivery. You’ll know how to get the most out of them—structuring prompts, validating outputs, and ensuring the code you ship is robust, clean, and production-ready.

Raise the Bar on Quality

Apply strong engineering discipline:

Write and maintain

unit tests (Jest or equivalent)

and

end-to-end tests (Playwright)

Use static analysis, peer reviews, and continuous improvement of AI prompts

Build software that is secure, maintainable, and enterprise-ready

Shape the Future of Safety Tech

Share your knowledge by mentoring teammates in AI-driven workflows and contributing to a culture that values quality, velocity, and innovation.

Why Forwood?

Mission-Driven Impact:

Your code will directly enable safety leaders to protect their people.

AI-First Workflow:

We embrace AI tooling as a core part of how we work—accelerating development without compromising quality.

Cutting-Edge Stack:

React, Remix, NestJS, TypeScript, Terraform, Docker, AWS ECS/RDS, and AI copilots.

Collaborative Environment:

A tight-knit, remote-first team that values mentorship, continuous learning, and open communication.

What We’re Looking For

Strong experience with

React/Remix, NestJS, and TypeScript

Daily use of

AI copilots

to ship faster, safer, and cleaner code

Proven ability to validate and secure AI-assisted code with testing and reviews

A production mindset: everything you build is

robust, maintainable, and enterprise-ready

Based in

Australia

(remote role, with AU timezone collaboration)

If you’re excited to combine solid engineering practices with AI-assisted workflows—and to use that capability to help prevent workplace fatalities—we’d love to hear from you.

This role is 100% remote but must be based in Australia.
