This is an exciting opportunity to work on real-time gameplay, complex transaction flows, and high-scale systems in a regulated environment.

What You’ll Be Doing:

Frontend Development

•	Collaborate closely with UI/UX designers to deliver pixel-perfect experiences.

Backend Development

•	Design and develop robust APIs and services using .NET Core or Node.js.

•	Implement logic for user accounts, gameplay sessions, transaction handling, and compliance.

•	Ensure high availability and performance of backend systems.

Integration & Infrastructure

•	Work with third-party APIs (game providers, payment gateways, analytics).

•	Use SQL, Redis, and other storage technologies effectively.

•	Collaborate on DevOps tasks including CI/CD, containerization (Docker), and deployments.

Collaboration & Agile

•	Participate in sprint planning, stand-ups, and code reviews.

•	Work cross-functionally with QA, product, and design teams.

•	Contribute ideas to improve processes, code quality, and team productivity.

What We’re Looking For:

Required:

•	5+ years of experience in full stack development.

•	Strong experience with modern JavaScript (React and/or Vue preferred).

•	Solid knowledge of backend frameworks such as .NET Core or Node.js.

•	Good understanding of REST APIs, authentication (JWT, OAuth), and web security best practices.

•	Experience with gRPC/Protobuf and/or GraphQL for service communication.

•	Experience with relational databases (PostgreSQL and/or MSSQL) and caching tools like Redis.

•	Familiar with Git, CI/CD, and containerization (Docker).

Bonus Points For:

•	Experience in online gambling, gaming, or fintech platforms.

•	Familiarity with Kubernetes and AWS cloud services.

•	Exposure to third-party integrations with game or payment providers.

•	Experience working in a regulated or multi-jurisdictional environment.

•	Knowledge of blockchain technologies, smart contracts, or crypto payment integration.

Why Join Us:

•	Join a high-growth company in the iGaming space.

•	Work with modern tools and architecture in a collaborative environment.

•	Influence key systems that power real money gameplay.

•	Competitive salary + performance bonuses.

•	Career progression opportunities in a fast-moving industry.

•	Enjoy free lunches and barista-grade coffee every day.

•	Work from our brand-new, modern office designed for comfort and productivity.
