KurrawongAI is looking for a software engineer to join our small team of specialist software professionals working on Knowledge Graphs and AI.

This is a full-time role, based in Brisbane, but work-from-home with occasional team get-togethers.

KurrawongAI is a small, Australian, specialist Knowledge Graph + AI company that provides data system consultation, software development and system management to government and industry clients. We are increasingly building our own KG + AI platform products, based on the things our clients find useful. We have a unique set of clients who are interested in semantic data and we have staff with academic, government and industry experience in this area.

Currently we are working on several high-impact projects such as the development and delivery of a national biodiversity database for government Environmental Impact Assessment decision making and geology AI systems for mining companies. We are also working extensively within international data standards organisations and are now developing a 3D spatial data standard for graph technology. We are small but have a couple of areas of world-leading capability.

We use a range of 3rd party and in-house developed applications for projects and need a proficient software developer to take responsibility for the continued development delivery of several of these, and to also join our pool of consulting engineers.

Of immediate need is the configuration and extension of an open source Java graph database, the maintenance and extension of a number of our Python API tools and deployment of some of these via different cloud platforms.

Regarding career development: we want people to develop and grow. We are a small company but one that is growing and taking on ever larger and more important projects. A person performing well in this role will be able to grow with us and move into software leadership, technical specialist or senior consultant roles.
