The Opportunity

We’re on the hunt for a Lead Software Engineer who loves building great software

and

helping others do the same. Think of this as a hands-on coding role with bonus powers: setting the technical direction, shaping the stack, and mentoring the team so everyone levels up together.

You’ll get to:

Design and deliver secure, resilient, future-ready systems

Roll up your sleeves and ship code that actually makes it to prod

Influence architecture, patterns, and tech choices (yes, your opinion matters!)

Champion best practices and keep raising the engineering bar

Be part of our digital transformation journey, building the next-gen products and platforms

Here’s what you’ll be owning:

Software Development and Leadership:

Designing and delivering scalable, secure digital products, setting best practices for architecture, coding, testing and documentation. Reviewing team code and driving continuous improvement through leading by example

Technical Strategy and Innovation:

Guides tech stack and architectural decisions, promotes modern technologies, and drives DevSecOps adoption with a focus on automation and security

Stakeholder Collaboration:

Builds strong relationships across teams, communicates complex technical concepts clearly, and ensures alignment for collaborative decision-making and able to lead agile ceremonies

Continuous Learning and Mentorship:

Stays updated on industry trends, mentors engineers, and fosters knowledge sharing and professional growth

We’re big on modern practices and we hold ourselves to high standards, but we keep things practical. No endless process for the sake of process. Just solid engineering, delivered well. From AI and multi-agent systems to AWS, Java 21, CI/CD, Playwright and MCP, chances are it’s already in our stack.

We’re looking for someone who’s a problem solver at heart, loves to share knowledge and gets a kick out of creating elegant, fit-for-purpose solutions. Technically, you’ll have:

10+ years of professional software development experience in full-stack environments

Strong expertise in JavaScript (React) and/or Java or C#, and Node.js
