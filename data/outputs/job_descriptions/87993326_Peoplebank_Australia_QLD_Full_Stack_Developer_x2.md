About the roles

Our client's Customer Identity & Access Management (CIAM) is the enterprise platform enabling individuals and organisations to sign in once, manage profiles, and securely access multiple apps. It offers single sign-on, account recovery, unified profiles, CIAM APIs (via APIM), and an internal admin CRM with synced customer data. Phase 1 delivered core features and initial app onboarding. The current phase adds RAM, organisational onboarding, identity linking, and delegated access via myID and ATO RAM, alongside ongoing app integration and admin upgrades.
