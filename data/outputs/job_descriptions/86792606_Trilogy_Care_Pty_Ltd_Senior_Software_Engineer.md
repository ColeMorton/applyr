At Trilogy Care, AI isn’t a side project, it’s how we build.

We’re hiring engineers who think AI-first and want to apply that mindset to transform health & care tech. If you’re looking to engineer with AI as part of your everyday toolkit, this is where your work makes an immediate impact.

We believe in using technology to give people more time to care, connect and change lives.  AI doesn't replace the human touch - it enables it. By reducing repetitive tasks and increasing access to insights, we’re freeing up time for our people to focus on what matters most: delivering better support and outcomes for our clients. At Trilogy Care, we’re not just tweaking an old system - we’re rebuilding the future of aged care from the ground up, powered by AI, automation and cloud-native tech. As an industry first-mover in practical AI, we’ve embedded real autonomy, experimentation and velocity into the heart of our tech team. Every employee from Development to front-line care has access to generative AI tools at their fingertips. You’ll be part of a fast-growing product and engineering function solving deeply human challenges with modern tools, agile ways of working, and a chance to create real social impact.

As a Senior Software Engineer, you’ll work across a full stack environment-designing and delivering accessible, scalable, and maintainable features in a cross-functional team. You’ll play a key role in how cloud-native tools, AI-driven insights, and rich UI components come together to support decision-making and care delivery.
