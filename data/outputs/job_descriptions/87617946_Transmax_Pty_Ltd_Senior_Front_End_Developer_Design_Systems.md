About Transmax

Transmax is an Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) provider and creator of the award-winning STREAMS® platform, helping traffic management centres across Australia move millions of commuters and freight every day. We’re reimagining STREAMS to deliver the next generation of modern, accessible, and sustainable ITS solutions that make roads safer and communities more connected.

About the Role

We’re seeking a Senior Front-End Developer (Design Systems) – Level 3 to join our Product Design & Research Group on a 12-month maximum term contract.

This role goes beyond hands-on coding – you’ll provide technical leadership, shape product direction, and drive design system adoption. As the technical owner, you will build and maintain reusable, accessible, and performant components that embed modern practices, ensure consistency, and accelerate delivery across STREAMS in partnership with the Design Systems Lead.

Requirements

What You’ll Do

We value a mindset that puts customers first, bridges design and engineering, and creates inclusive, future-ready solutions. In this role, you will:

·       Build intuitive, performant, and accessible web interfaces for our ITS suite.

·       Own and evolve the design system, driving its maturity, scalability, and adoption across product areas.

·       Collaborate with the Design Systems Lead in a product trio/duo model to translate concepts into user-ready, market-focused solutions.

·       Champion usability, inclusive design, and accessibility standards.

·       Communicate technical solutions effectively, using clear documentation and storytelling to embed practices across the organisation.

·       Provide mentorship and technical leadership through code reviews, pairing, and workshops, uplifting capability and confidence across teams.

·       Drive innovation and continuous improvement, embedding best practices in accessibility, security, and performance.

·       Take proactive ownership of opportunities to enhance design system maturity and influence adoption.

What You’ll Bring

We’re looking for a senior front-end leader who can balance hands-on expertise with technical influence, product thinking, and driving solutions from concept to delivery. Your expertise will include:

·       Tertiary qualification in Software Engineering, Information Technology, or Computer Science.

·       Strong track record delivering complex, scalable front-end solutions, with deep expertise in React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern state management patterns.

·       Proven experience designing and extending reusable component libraries (e.g., npm, MUI), with strong skills in design system tooling such as Storybook, Figma, and Zeroheight.

·       An eye for design and strong appreciation of user experience principles.

·       Strong knowledge of WCAG 2.1 AA and ARIA standards, with a commitment to accessibility-first development.

·       Ability to design and maintain robust testing strategies including unit, visual regression, and accessibility tests (Playwright, Selenium, Jest).

·       Experience working in cross-functional Agile teams, with proficiency in Git and CI/CD pipelines for automated build and deployment.

·       Excellent collaboration and communication skills, with the ability to bridge design, product, and engineering.

Desirable Extras

·       Exposure to back-end languages (.NET, Python, C#).

·       Experience with cloud and containerised environments (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker).

·       Understanding of secure networking and APIs (REST, gRPC, JSON, Protobuf).

Benefits
