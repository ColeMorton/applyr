Full job description

About the Role

We’re on the lookout for multiple passionate and highly capable Software Engineers (Frontend - Vue.js) to join our high-performing, fast-paced Technology team. These are initial 6 month contract opportunities working on a new product being built on our current stack (fitting in to our existing environments & setup).

In this role, you’ll help shape the digital experience for thousands of users — designing, building, and delivering high-quality software that performs at scale and pushes the boundaries of what’s possible. You’ll work with a talented group of technologists to help Entain remain a leader in wagering products. If the wagering world is not for you, we completely understand, but we are super excited for this new piece of work.

Where And How You Can Work...

We have offices across Australia and New Zealand, and this role is open to remote candidates.

We offer a hybrid working model (Brisbane HQ, Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington or Auckland)— balancing the benefits of in-person collaboration with the flexibility of remote work. We’re committed to helping you do your best work in a way that fits your lifestyle.

Key Responsibilities

Contribute to the end-to-end SDLC, from early analysis and architecture through to testing and deployment.

Write well-designed, testable, and scalable code that adheres to established standards and best practices.

Actively participate in team discussions, helping guide the direction of projects through thoughtful input and technical expertise.

Assist in quality assurance processes by collaborating with QAs to ensure high standards of software delivery.

Communicate and collaborate with external teams and stakeholders across the business.

Work closely with team leads and senior engineers to contribute to continuous improvement initiatives and processes.

Skills and Experience

Proven experience in software engineering within a modern Agile delivery environment, ideally aligned with our tech stack.

Strong understanding of web, mobile, or backend technologies and standards. Vue.js is essential in this role.

Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and deployment tooling.

Working knowledge of databases (SQL, NoSQL) and Jira or similar platforms.

Great problem-solving skills and the ability to assess technical risk and mitigate proactively.

Knowledge or experience with automated testing frameworks and methodologies.

An appetite to grow, share knowledge, and work as part of a united, inclusive team.
