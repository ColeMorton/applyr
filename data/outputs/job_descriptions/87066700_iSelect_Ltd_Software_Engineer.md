Who We Are

iSelect and Compare the Market are trusted, well-known brands dedicated to helping millions of Australians compare and buy personal finance and household products such as insurance, energy, and loans. Together, we provide a seamless, customer-focused experience that makes it easier for Australians to find the right products to suit their needs.

What You’ll Be Doing

We're looking for a Software Engineer who loves solving real problems with clean, scalable code. Someone who wants a say in how things get built and enjoys working with people who feel the same.

As a Software Engineer with us, you’ll get to:

Build great software

– Deliver secure, scalable products with clean code and solid standards, while helping lift the team’s quality of work

Shape our tech direction

– Have a say in architecture, design patterns and the stack. We value smart questions and fresh ideas!

Work the modern way

– Agile, DevSecOps, automation, CI/CD, event-driven architectures and cloud-first are part of how we build

Collaborate widely

– Turn ideas into working solutions with product owners, PMs, and architects, explaining tech in plain language

Keep learning and sharing

– Stay curious, explore new tools, and help the team grow through knowledge sharing

We’re big on modern practices and we hold ourselves to high standards, but we keep things practical. No endless process for the sake of process. Just solid engineering, delivered well. From AI and multi-agent systems to AWS, Java 21, CI/CD, Playwright and MCP, chances are it’s already in our stack.

What’s In It For You

At Compare the Market and iSelect, we’re all about helping people make smart choices – and joining us might just be yours. We offer an environment where your ideas are heard, your contributions are valued, and your growth genuinely matters. Collaboration is part of our DNA, and you’ll be joining a supportive, forward-thinking team where you can do meaningful work (and be recognised for it!)

We’re guided by three shared values that shape how we work, how we treat each other, and how we show up for our customers - Drive, Noble Intent and All Together.

Plus, we offer a range of great perks to help you thrive both in and out of work:

Vibrant and social community who have annual celebrations, family fun days and regular events

Enjoy flexible work arrangements, including the option of one day working from home each week or a 9-day fortnight

Enjoy additional leave days - ‘ME’ leave and ‘Volunteer Day’ leave

Employee discounts on car and home and contents insurance

Income protection insurance provided to support you in the event of non-work-related illness or injury

What Sets You Apart

We’d love to hear from natural collaborators with:

3+ years of software development experience in full-stack environments

Expertise in JavaScript (React) and/or Java, and Node.js

Experience with AWS cloud technologies, serverless and event-driven architectures

Experience with modern CI/CD practices, observability, and end-to-end software development

Experience in regulated industries and hybrid delivery models is desirable
