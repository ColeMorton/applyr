Senior & Mid-Level Software Engineer (AI / .NET / React / AWS)

Initial term: 6 months (potential/likely extension)

Availability: Immediate start possible

Location: Brisbane, 3 days in the office

Both roles will contribute to building holistic digital solutions (including AI-centric components) to drive operational efficiency and redefine how technology supports the business.

You'll be part of a team tackling high-value projects, using a modern stack involving mobile and web interfaces, and cloud-first architectures, streaming data and Gen AI.

They are looking for forward-thinking engineers, who have an experimental mindset, can think outside of the box and bring fresh ideas on how to build, automate, and document better.

Strong experience in .NET, React, and AWS is a must, with an ability to bridge the gap between traditional software development and modern cloud engineering.
