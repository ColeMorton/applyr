### 1. Cross-Platform Architecture (React/React Native)

**Key Concept**: Share business logic, platform-specific UI

```typescript
// Shared business logic
export const useBudgetCalculations = (transactions: Transaction[]) => {
  return useMemo(() => {
    const spent = transactions.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0);
    const remaining = totalBudget - spent;
    return { spent, remaining, burnRate: calculateBurnRate(transactions) };
  }, [transactions]);
};

// Platform-specific components
// Web (React)
const BudgetDisplay: React.FC = ({ budget }) => (
  <div className="budget-card" role="main">
    <CircularProgress value={budget.percentage} />
  </div>
);

// Mobile (React Native)
const BudgetDisplay: React.FC = ({ budget }) => (
  <View accessible accessibilityRole="main">
    <ProgressCircle percent={budget.percentage} />
  </View>
);
```

### 2. Performance Optimization Strategies

**Real Experience: Panorama Berlin QR Scanning App**
Building my first React Native app for a fashion event taught me crucial lessons about device compatibility. While core QR scanning functionality worked perfectly for 1000+ attendees, older Android devices presented challenges that shaped my approach to cross-platform development.

**For Elderly Users on Older Devices**:
```typescript
// React Native FlatList optimization
<FlatList
  data={clients}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  getItemLayout={getItemLayout}    // Prevents measurement
  removeClippedSubviews={true}      // Unmount off-screen
  maxToRenderPerBatch={10}          // Reduce initial render
  windowSize={10}                    // Reduce memory
  initialNumToRender={5}            // Fast initial display
/>

// Measuring performance with production monitoring
const onRenderCallback = (id, phase, actualDuration) => {
  // Track to analytics (used Sentry at Panorama Berlin)
  analytics.track('render_performance', {
    component: id,
    phase,
    duration: actualDuration,
    slowRender: actualDuration > 16.67 // Over 1 frame
  });
};

// Production monitoring approach from real experience
const setupProductionMonitoring = () => {
  // Sentry for error tracking and performance
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
    integrations: [
      new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing(),
    ],
    tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
  });
  
  // Custom performance tracking
  performance.mark('app_start');
  InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions(() => {
    performance.mark('app_interactive');
    performance.measure('time_to_interactive', 'app_start', 'app_interactive');
  });
};
```

### 3. Healthcare API Security

**Real Experience from CharmHealth**: Building WCF API services for hospital drug lists taught me that healthcare APIs require multiple security layers. Every API endpoint had audit trails, encryption, and strict access controls baked in from the start.

**Key Principles for Aged Care**:
```typescript
// Multi-layer security approach (similar to CharmHealth implementation)
const secureApiCall = async (endpoint: string, data: any) => {
  // 1. Authentication
  const token = await getValidToken(); // Auto-refresh
  
  // 2. Audit trail (regulatory requirement)
  const requestId = generateUUID();
  
  // 3. Encryption (patient data protection)
  const encrypted = await encryptPayload(data);
  
  // 4. Call with security headers
  return fetch(endpoint, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'X-Request-ID': requestId,
      'X-Audit-User': userId,
    },
    body: encrypted
  });
};
```

### 4. AI Integration Patterns

**Evolution from Traditional to AI-Enhanced Systems**
My technical journey spans traditional enterprise (.NET at CharmHealth), modern web frameworks (React.js at Crosslend), mobile development (React Native at Panorama), to cutting-edge experimentation (Oetker Digital incubator). This progression gives me unique perspective on integrating AI into existing systems - I understand both legacy constraints and modern possibilities.

**Privacy-First AI for Healthcare**:
```typescript
class CareNotesAI {
  private edgeModel: TFLiteModel; // On-device processing
  
  async generateSuggestion(context: CareContext) {
    // Never send PHI to cloud
    const deidentified = await this.removePHI(context);
    const suggestion = await this.edgeModel.predict(deidentified);
    
    // Validate for hallucinations
    const validated = await this.factCheck(suggestion, context);
    
    return {
      text: validated.text,
      confidence: validated.confidence,
      explanation: this.explainSuggestion(validated)
    };
  }
}
```

## üé≠ Behavioral Response Frameworks

### The PREP Method
**P**oint ‚Üí **R**eason ‚Üí **E**xample ‚Üí **P**oint

**Example**: "How do you handle technical debt?"
- **Point**: "I treat technical debt as a business metric, not just an engineering concern."
- **Reason**: "Because unmanaged debt directly impacts feature velocity and customer satisfaction."
- **Example**: "At my last role, I created a 'debt impact score' showing that auth debt added 3 days per feature. We got immediate buy-in to fix it."
- **Point**: "For Trilogy's rapid growth, this approach ensures we maintain velocity while improving quality."

### The STAR Method
**S**ituation ‚Üí **T**ask ‚Üí **A**ction ‚Üí **R**esult

**Example**: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a product decision"
- **Situation**: "Product wanted to launch health records feature before security audit for Mother's Day campaign"
- **Task**: "Balance $200K revenue opportunity with compliance risks"
- **Action**: "Proposed launching photo sharing first (low risk), health records after audit. Created visual risk/revenue timeline"
- **Result**: "Captured 60% revenue, zero compliance violations, Product now involves Engineering earlier"

### Quantification Guidelines
Always transform vague to valuable:

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "Improved performance" | "Reduced load time from 3s to 800ms" |
| "Led a team" | "Led 5 engineers to deliver 3-month project" |
| "Saved money" | "Cut AWS costs by $50K/year" |
| "Fixed bugs" | "Reduced critical bugs by 75% (20 to 5 monthly)" |

## ‚ùì Master Question Bank

### Technical Questions & Answers

**Q: "How would you architect a real-time budget tracking feature for elderly clients?"**

**A**: "I'd design a three-tier approach focusing on accessibility and reliability:

**Frontend Architecture**: 
- Shared React/React Native components with platform-specific UI
- WCAG 2.2 compliance with 48px minimum touch targets
- High contrast mode and scalable fonts for vision impairment

**Real-time Sync**:
- WebSocket for instant updates with exponential backoff
- Offline queue with conflict resolution using timestamps
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback

**Performance**:
- React.memo for expensive renders
- Virtual scrolling for transaction lists
- Progressive loading: last 30 days ‚Üí 90 days ‚Üí full history

For Trilogy's elderly users on older devices, I'd prioritize performance and ensure the app works smoothly even on 3-year-old budget Android phones. At Panorama Berlin, I learned this firsthand - while our core QR scanning worked flawlessly, we had minor issues on older, uncommon mobile devices. This taught me the importance of testing across a wide device range, especially critical for elderly users who may not have the latest phones."

**Q: "How do you balance rapid feature delivery with compliance requirements?"**

**A**: "I use a risk-based approach with clear categorization:

**Compliance Firewall**: Any feature touching care records or billing gets automatic additional review and testing. Non-negotiable.

**Feature Flags**: Deploy behind flags with gradual rollout - 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%. This allows quick deployment with safety nets.

**Automated Compliance**: Build ACQSC requirements into CI/CD pipeline - can't deploy if compliance tests fail.

At Panorama Berlin, I had to make this exact trade-off - ensure the payment system was bulletproof for real financial transactions while managing feature requests from multiple event booths. I chose reliability over features and used monitoring (Sentry) to track the system in production. For Trilogy, I'd establish similar guardrails that ensure core care functionality and billing accuracy while maintaining development velocity."

### Behavioral Questions & Answers

**Q: "What's your greatest weakness?"**

**A**: "My attraction to new technologies can sometimes distract from proven solutions. At Oetker Digital's startup incubator, I had access to many emerging technologies through rapid prototyping. While this was exciting, I sometimes found myself drawn to 'shiny new things' even when they weren't necessary for the solution.

I've learned to apply a disciplined evaluation framework: Does it solve a current pain point? What's the migration cost? What's the team learning curve? At Panorama Berlin, I had to make this exact trade-off - focus on core QR scanning functionality rather than implementing every feature request from event booths.

This discipline paid off - the core scanning system worked flawlessly on event day with 1000+ attendees, while the compromise solution still allowed booths to integrate promotions. For Trilogy's AI-first approach, this balance would help identify genuinely transformative AI features versus trendy add-ons."

**Q: "Why are you leaving your current role?"**

**A**: "My wife and I have been planning to move to Brisbane since she first visited in 2018. We have family here - her brother owns a business and his wife is a nurse - so we've always felt connected to this city. Moving to Australia also brings me closer to my 96-year-old grandfather in New Zealand, who I lived with growing up and who taught me so much about engineering excellence.

Trilogy caught my attention for three compelling reasons:

1. Your remarkable growth from 46th to 7th shows execution excellence - similar to the scaling I experienced at Crosslend (2 to 25+ developers)
2. Your AI-first approach aligns with my interest in healthcare innovation - I've already worked on Australian healthcare systems at CharmHealth here in Brisbane
3. Your mission to 'give people more time to care' resonates deeply, especially given my experience building systems for Prince Alfred Hospital and my personal understanding of elderly independence through my grandfather

I'm excited to build my career in Brisbane's thriving tech scene while being closer to family and starting a family of my own here."

**Q: "Why should we hire you?"**

**A**: "I bring three unique qualifications that directly address Trilogy's current challenges:

**Australian healthcare systems experience with compliance**: At CharmHealth in Brisbane, I built WCF API services managing drug lists for multiple hospitals with strict regulatory compliance. I was honored to work on the high-profile Prince Alfred Hospital oncology and patient management system. This direct Australian healthcare experience means I understand ACQSC-type requirements and can navigate compliance while delivering features.

**Proven scaling experience matching your growth trajectory**: As the second developer at Crosslend, I helped scale the engineering team from 2 to 25+ while building their lending platform with financial regulatory compliance. This mirrors Trilogy's rapid growth from 46th to 7th. I've lived through the challenges of maintaining quality and compliance during hypergrowth.

**Technical versatility with user-focused delivery**: My progression from .NET (healthcare) to React.js (FinTech) to React Native (events) to multi-stack (startup incubator) demonstrates adaptability. At Panorama Berlin, I prioritized core QR scanning functionality over feature bloat, ensuring flawless operation for 1000+ users. This same pragmatic approach would help Trilogy balance feature delivery with reliability.

What sets me apart isn't just technical skills - it's having successfully navigated Australian healthcare compliance, scaled engineering teams, and consistently delivered reliable systems under pressure. Plus, with my personal connection to elderly independence through my 96-year-old grandfather, your mission genuinely resonates with me."

### Questions to Ask Interviewers

**Technical/Role**:
1. "What have been the biggest technical scaling challenges going from 46th to 7th, and what's still keeping the team up at night?"
2. "Can you share a specific example of how AI has transformed a process at Trilogy, and where you see the next opportunities?"
3. "How does the engineering team balance rapid feature delivery with ACQSC compliance requirements?"

**Strategic/Culture**:
1. "With Support at Home expanding consumer choice, how is engineering preparing for increased demand for self-managed care?"
2. "How do you ensure care workers who might not be tech-savvy feel empowered rather than replaced by AI tools?"

**Career/Team**:
1. "What does success look like for a Senior Software Engineer in the first 90 days and at one year?"
2. "How is the engineering team structured, and how do you maintain collaboration with the hybrid model?"

**Power Move**:
"Based on our conversation, what hesitations might you have about my fit for this role? I'd love to address those while we're together."

**Additional Behavioral Questions with Your Experience**:

**Q: "Tell me about a time you had to handle a difficult team situation."**

**A**: "At Oetker Digital, during a particularly stressful project with multiple time constraints, our project manager became overwhelmed and actually shouted at the team during a meeting - even banging on the table. I could see this was counterproductive and damaging to team morale.

After the meeting, I took the initiative to approach her privately. Instead of confronting the behavior, I focused on understanding the root pressures and discussing optimal solutions given our constraints. This one-on-one conversation made a huge difference - her stress levels decreased, team dynamics improved, and I became someone she could turn to for support going forward.

This experience taught me that sometimes leadership means stepping up informally to support both team members and management. For Trilogy's rapid growth environment, I'd bring this same approach to help maintain team cohesion during high-pressure situations."

**Q: "Tell me about your experience with compliance and regulated industries."**

**A**: "I have extensive experience across two highly regulated sectors:

**Healthcare at CharmHealth**: Built WCF API services for hospital drug lists where every API call had to meet strict regulatory requirements. The drug data we managed directly impacted patient care, so accuracy and compliance were non-negotiable. I also worked on the Prince Alfred Hospital oncology system where patient data protection and audit trails were critical.

**Financial Services at Crosslend**: As the second developer, I helped build a lending platform where every calculation had real monetary impact. We implemented automated compliance checks in our CI/CD pipeline and maintained detailed audit logs for financial regulators.

This dual experience taught me that compliance isn't a hindrance to innovation - it's a framework that ensures we build trustworthy systems. For Trilogy, I'd apply these same principles to navigate ACQSC requirements while maintaining your impressive growth velocity. I understand how to build features that are both innovative and compliant from the ground up."

**Q: "What draws you personally to the aged care technology space?"**

**A**: "My personal connection comes through my 96-year-old grandfather in New Zealand, who I lived with growing up. He's a highly respected engineer who taught me so much about problem-solving and attention to detail. Watching him navigate technology at his age has given me deep appreciation for systems that work intuitively.

He lives independently, which I admire, but I see how technology can either empower or frustrate him. Simple interfaces work beautifully, but complex ones create barriers. This has shaped my approach to development - I always consider whether my 96-year-old grandfather could use what I'm building.

Trilogy's mission to 'give people more time to care' resonates because I understand the value of independence and dignity. Technology should enhance human connections, not replace them. Plus, being closer to him now that we've moved to Australia is important to me, especially as my wife and I look forward to starting our own family.

I also have family connections here - my sister-in-law is a nurse, so I have insights into the healthcare system from both the patient and provider perspectives. This combination gives me unique empathy for what Trilogy is trying to achieve."

**Q: "Describe a project where you had to make difficult prioritization decisions."**

**A**: "At Panorama Berlin, I was building a React Native payment app for a major fashion event as the sole developer. Each event booth had submitted feature requests creating a sizable backlog, but the timeline was fixed - event day was coming whether we were ready or not.

I had to make a critical decision: try to implement every requested feature and risk the core functionality being unreliable, or focus on bulletproof core features and find creative compromises.

I chose to prioritize the core QR scanning and payment functionality, then designed a compromise that allowed booths to integrate promotions and special offers through the existing QR system. This satisfied their main business need while keeping the technical scope manageable.

Result: On event day, with 1000+ attendees, the core payment and scanning worked flawlessly. We had some minor issues on older devices, but the critical functionality was rock-solid. The CTO was so impressed he personally recruited me for his next company.

For Trilogy, this same prioritization discipline would be valuable - focusing on features that directly impact care quality and compliance while finding creative ways to satisfy stakeholder requests."
