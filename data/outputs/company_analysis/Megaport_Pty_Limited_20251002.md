Expected outcome: 450-500M AUD revenue by FY2028, 40%+ NaaS market share, 10-15% operating margin, geographic expansion to 30+ countries with 1,500+ locations.

**Base Case (Probability: 0.55)** - Megaport maintains 10Gbps MCR limitation creating persistent competitive gap, multicloud adoption continues at current 15-19% annual growth trajectory, profitability volatility continues with modest margins, security services development progresses with uncertain market traction. Expected outcome: 350-400M AUD revenue by FY2028, market leadership maintained but Equinix Fabric gains high-bandwidth segment share, 5-10% operating margin, geographic expansion to 28-30 countries with 1,200+ locations.

**Bear Case (Probability: 0.15)** - Equinix Fabric gains significant market share leveraging >10Gbps advantage and infrastructure ownership, economic downturn slows multicloud adoption and enterprise IT spending, cloud providers expand native interconnection services (AWS PrivateLink, Azure Private Link) creating disintermediation, profitability fails to sustain with recurring losses. Expected outcome: 300-330M AUD revenue by FY2028, market leadership eroded to 25-30% share, negative to break-even operating margin, geographic expansion stalls at 26-28 countries.

**Probability-Weighted Outlook**: Expected FY2028 revenue 370-410M AUD with modest sustained profitability (7-12% operating margin), market leadership maintained under increasing Equinix Fabric competitive pressure, vendor-neutral positioning and network effects providing competitive defense.
