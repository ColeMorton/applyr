- New Zealand expansion stalls due to competitive intensity or market entry barriers
- Construction/utilities vertical expansion fails to achieve product-market fit requiring refocus on core insurance
- Technology talent acquisition challenges in Brisbane limit innovation capacity and competitive response
- Self-funded capital constraints limit competitive response to well-capitalized competitors' customer acquisition spending
- Economic downturn reduces insurance industry technology spending budgets creating pricing pressure

**Financial Outcomes:**
- **Revenue Growth**: Annual revenue growth of 10-20% reaching $20-30M by 2028
- **Profitability**: Maintains profitability but margins compress to 10-15% EBITDA due to pricing pressure and competitive response costs

- **Market Share**: Market share declines to 5-8% as competitors capture growth in expanding market

**Strategic Outcomes:**
- Maintains core position with 3-4 major Australian insurers but limited expansion beyond existing base
- Geographic expansion into New Zealand stalls requiring refocus on Australian market depth
- Vertical diversification into construction/utilities abandoned to focus resources on core insurance competency

### Scenario Probability Validation

**Scenario Weighting Rationale:**
Baseline scenario (50% probability) reflects most likely path given proven execution track record, existing customer relationships providing stability, self-funded profitability enabling sustained operations, and favorable market growth tailwinds. Growth scenario (30%) constrained by private company capital limitations, geographic concentration requiring successful expansion, and increasing competitive intensity. Challenge scenario (20%) reflects real risks from customer concentration, enterprise platform down-market expansion, and well-capitalized competitor threats, though mitigated by integrated ecosystem switching costs and customer relationship depth.

**Expected Outcome (Probability-Weighted):**
Expected 2028 revenue of $35-50M with sustained profitability (18-22% EBITDA margins), 8-12 major Australian insurer customers, emerging New Zealand presence with 1-2 customers, moderate vertical diversification success, and strengthened competitive positioning through deeper customer integrations and ecosystem moat development. Company maintains strategic flexibility for continued independence or strategic options based on competitive dynamics and growth opportunities.

**Confidence Score: 0.85**

**Strategic Investment Thesis:**

**Bull Case (Probability: 0.30)** - Codafication successfully expands beyond current 5 major insurers capturing 3-5 additional major Australian customers, accelerates New Zealand market entry with 2-3 anchor customers generating $5M+ revenue, achieves construction/utilities vertical product-market fit with $3-5M revenue, secures strategic growth capital maintaining independence, and scales team to 100+ employees. Expected outcome: $50-75M revenue by 2028 with 40-60% annual growth, 15-20% EBITDA margins, $150-250M valuation (5-8x revenue), 15-20% Australian mid-market InsurTech share, positions for strategic acquisition or potential IPO 2029-2031.

**Base Case (Probability: 0.50)** - Codafication continues steady self-funded growth adding 1-2 major Australian insurers annually reaching 8-10 total by 2028, New Zealand expansion achieves 1-2 customers with $2-3M revenue, construction/utilities generates $1-2M revenue with pilot success, maintains profitability throughout period with organic growth capital. Expected outcome: $35-50M revenue by 2028 with 25-35% annual growth, 20-25% EBITDA margins, $100-150M valuation (3-4x revenue), 10-15% market share maintained, strengthens Australian mid-market leadership with continued independence or strategic options based on founder preference.

**Bear Case (Probability: 0.20)** - Competitive pressure intensifies from enterprise platforms expanding down-market and cloud-native competitors entering Australia, customer concentration risk materializes with major customer loss, market growth slows to 10-15% due to economic headwinds, New Zealand expansion stalls, vertical diversification fails. Expected outcome: $20-30M revenue by 2028 with 10-20% growth, margins compress to 10-15% EBITDA, $35-60M valuation (2-2.5x revenue), market share declines to 5-8%, maintains core 3-4 customers but struggles to expand, considers strategic acquisition or PE investment for capital.

**Probability-Weighted Outlook**: Expected 2028 revenue $35-50M with sustained 18-22% EBITDA margins, 8-12 major Australian insurer customers, emerging New Zealand presence (1-2 customers), moderate vertical diversification success, strengthened competitive positioning through deeper integrations and ecosystem moat, strategic flexibility for continued independence or strategic options based on competitive dynamics and growth opportunities.
