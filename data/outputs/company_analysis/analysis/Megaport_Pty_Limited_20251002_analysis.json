      "bull_case": "Megaport is the world largest NaaS platform with clear market leadership, vendor-neutral differentiation, and strong multicloud positioning. First profitability (FY2024) validates business model. 1000+ locations, comprehensive cloud partnerships, and 244M ARR create defensible advantages. 30% CAGR demonstrates market traction.",
      "bear_case": "Equinix Fabric technical advantages threaten market leadership. Profitability volatility raises execution concerns. 10Gbps MCR limitation constrains enterprise expansion. Stock price decline (down 61% over 3 years) despite revenue growth signals market skepticism. Cloud provider native services create disintermediation risk.",
      "base_case": "Megaport maintains market leadership with 15-19% annual revenue growth (FY2026 guidance 260-270M AUD) and modest profitability (5-10% operating margin). Vendor-neutral positioning provides competitive defense, but Equinix Fabric gains share in high-bandwidth segment. Geographic expansion and product innovation drive revenue diversification."
