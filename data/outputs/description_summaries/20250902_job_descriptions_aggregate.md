Join the revolution in workforce management.

foundU is Australian-grown and managed, home to 75 passionate people who are committed to accelerating the success of Australian businesses.

We've created a platform that streamlines recruitment, onboarding, rostering, timesheet management, payroll, and reporting for a seamless experience. We’re in the business of building things most people haven’t thought of yet. The pace is fast, and the work is challenging. We dream big, and we fight hard for customer ease.

About the Role

As a Senior Front-End Developer, you will play a crucial role in the Engineering Team, elevating the capability of foundU's library of components and driving innovation in our solutions. In close collaboration with UX and Product Owners, this role will be accountable for all front-end development efforts, with a focus on feature development project work; building and enhancing components across our main web application and react-native apps.

In this role, you will:

Collaborate with the Lead Product Designer to develop and deliver innovative solutions to improve the foundU platform, applications and design library.

Serve as an expert in front-end development, creating and maintaining a comprehensive component library that meets the evolving needs of the platform.

Develop and improve the organisation's library of components to enhance the user experience of the platform and apps.

Provide guidance and mentorship to developers, while working closely with the Product and Engineering teams to deliver high-quality products.

Take a hands-on approach to writing tests, performing code reviews, and collaborating with peers to ensure best practices are followed.

Drive innovation and explore new technologies, keeping up-to-date with industry trends and advancements where feasible.

Provide thought leadership in agile ceremonies and team meetings, serving as a subject matter expert and driving decision-making with a focus on delivering high-quality products with the best interests of the customer in mind.

Develop and implement best practices for front-end development, ensuring the team is operating efficiently and effectively.

Contribute to the continuous improvement of the front-end development process, driving efficiency and productivity, and elevating the team's skills and capabilities.

Our tech stack:

VueJs, React Native, ES6+, Sass

Storybook, Cypress, Jest, Webpack, etc.

Laravel, PHP

MySQL

RESTful APIs

Supporting Services

AWS (EC2, Aurora, Elasticache, WAF, ALBs, ECS, Lambda, Elasticsearch, etc.)

Do you have the foundU DNA?

Creating a product that helps so many businesses get pay right for their employees is pretty special and it’s not something we take for granted.

Our people come from all walks of life -but the one thing that binds us is a glass-half-full, sleeves rolled up, can-do mentality. At foundU, you’ll hear a lot of laughs, a fair share of banter, and the odd noisy debate as we nut out the best ways to adapt to whatever a new workplace law throws at us!

We are looking for someone who has:

Proven track record of designing and delivering successful software projects, showcasing architectural and problem-solving skills.

Proficiency in the foundU tech stack: Laravel, PHP, MySQL, RESTful APIs

Strong understanding of software development principles, design patterns, and best practices.

Ability to develop unit testing of code components or complete applications.

Experience with sprint methodologies and a collaborative team-oriented approach.

Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to convey complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Knowledge of Australian HR/Payroll is advantageous

Demonstrated leadership capabilities and a desire to mentor and elevate team members.

You’ll get bonus points if you have:

A background in payroll, human resources, or SaaS cloud technology

Why join foundU?

Growth

We are passionate about promoting from within. We prioritise the development and growth of our team members through up-skilling, cross-training, and maximising their potential. Diversity is celebrated and we strive to foster a culture of inclusiveness for all members of our team.

Innovation

We’ve cultivated a collaborative team culture where everyone's voice is heard and valued. We are committed to growth and improvement, embracing feedback and suggestions with an open mind. We always strive to enhance what we do and how we do it.

Collaboration

foundU became part of Citation Group in 2025. Supporting over 12,000 businesses across Australia and New Zealand, our extended team offers workplace compliance solutions spanning HR, employment law, work health and safety, and certification. On top of supporting a payroll platform that Australian businesses can count on, you’ll have the opportunity to collaborate with our tight-knit community of workplace experts.

Benefits

An established hybrid work policy.

A bonus week of annual leave after every 12 months at foundU.

Monthly ‘pocket money’ to purchase anything that supports your working life – such as training courses, an office chair or even a team lunch.

Free coffee from the local café while working from the office.

Dog friendly office.
