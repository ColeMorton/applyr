I'm a full-stack developer with 11 years of commercial experience across a spectrum of various technologies.

In 2013, after 3 years of professional full-stack .NET experience, I decided to shift to frontend web development and since that time, I've had the pleasure of witnessing the Javascript ecosystem evolve via heavyweights such as JQuery, Angular, Gulp, Webpack, React, Vue, Node and is now the most popular language of choice for open-source projects.

I'm highly enthusiastic and passionate about technology, especially regarding it's past, present and future political, economic and societal impact.

I have substantial experience in Agile Software Development and Scrum practices including sprint planning/estimations, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint retrospectives. As well as, Kanban, Continuous Delivery, Feature Driven, Test Driven and Behaviour Driven software development methodologies.

I have 11 years experience in the blockchain space and I founded the Taupemist non-profit cooperative organisation and its digital token in December 2017.
