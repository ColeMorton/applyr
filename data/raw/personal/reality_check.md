I haven't typed actual code in a year. Everything I've built recently has been through Claude, Copilot, or Cursor. While I've architected sophisticated systems and deployed production code, I genuinely can't remember if it's useState or usestate without autocomplete. The muscle memory for syntax is gone.
I'm terrified of coding tests. Despite building Sensylate and managing 28k+ lines of production code, the thought of a whiteboard interview or timed LeetCode challenge makes me break into a cold sweat. Four years without traditional interviews, peer reviews, or anyone looking over my shoulder has left me feeling like I'll be exposed as someone who can only code with AI assistance.
