# Interview Preparation Notes

## Personal Motivation & Background

My wife and I have discussed moving to Brisbane since her first visit in 2018. Her brother owns a business here and his wife works as a nurse, providing us with strong family connections. One of my primary motivators for relocating was to be closer to my grandfather, who is now 96 years old and living alone in New Zealand. I lived with my grandfather while growing upâ€”he is a highly respected engineer who taught me a great deal about problem-solving and technical thinking.

I'm excited to start a new career in Brisbane's thriving tech scene, and now that I'm closer to my brother and grandfather, I'm really looking forward to starting a family of my own.

## Professional Experience Stories

### CharmHealth - Healthcare Systems Development

**Situation**: I was employed at CharmHealth in Brisbane as a full-stack .NET developer, working on critical healthcare systems for multiple hospitals in the region.

**Task**: My initial responsibility involved using WCF API services to generate and update drug lists for multiple hospitals. Shortly after, I had the honor of working with a very high-profile team of contractors hired to build an oncology and patient management system for the new Prince Alfred hospital in Sydney.

**Action**: I ensured that strict regulatory compliance was a core criterion baked into all business logic, understanding the critical nature of healthcare software where accuracy could impact patient outcomes.

**Result**: Successfully delivered compliant healthcare solutions that met stringent regulatory requirements while maintaining system reliability for critical hospital operations.

### CrossLend - FinTech Platform Development

**Situation**: My first exposure to React.js was at a FinTech startup named CrossLend, where regulatory compliance and accuracy were essential.

**Task**: I joined this company as the third developer and played a pivotal role in growing their lending platform and development team.

**Action**: I contributed to scaling both the technical platform and the team structure, ensuring we maintained high standards while rapidly expanding.

**Result**: Successfully grew the development team from 3 people to over 20, while maintaining platform stability and regulatory compliance throughout the scaling process.

### Panorama Berlin - React Native Mobile Development

**Situation**: At Panorama Berlin, I was tasked with building a React Native app for a fashion show as the sole developer.

**Task**: The primary purpose of this app was to provide a payment solution for both event staff and attendees. Event staff would scan QR codes on the attendees' app, and there was a sizable backlog of features requested by each booth at the event.

**Action**: Due to time constraints, it was prudent to focus primarily on the core QR scanning feature to ensure it was highly robust. I made a compromise that allowed each booth to integrate with the existing QR scanning feature to provide promotions and special offers to attendees, rather than building separate features for each request.

**Result**: Come event day, the project was complete and I spent a long day monitoring Sentry. Minor non-feature-breaking errors occurred throughout the day stemming from older and uncommon mobile phones, but the QR code scanning worked flawlessly. The CTO was so impressed with the delivery that he personally invited me to join him when he decided to take a new role at Oetker Digital.

### Oetker Digital - Leadership & Team Support

**Situation**: Oetker Digital is the digital subsidiary of Dr. Oetker and startup incubator. I had the opportunity to work with many teams using various technologies, mostly React.js, TypeScript, and Node.js.

**Task**: During rapid prototyping, we experimented with many new technologies. However, the attraction to shiny new things could sometimes be considered a weakness, especially when they weren't necessary for the project goals.

**Action**: I remember at one meeting, the project manager appeared extremely stressed and physically expressed frustration with the team when features didn't meet her expectations. After the meeting, I took the initiative to sit down with her privately and discuss optimal solutions under pressure from multiple time constraints.

**Result**: This improved her morale greatly, and I became a source of support for her going forward, demonstrating my ability to provide leadership and emotional support during high-pressure situations.

## Career Positioning Statements

### Professional Vision

I see myself playing a key role within my team with a reputation for delivering high-quality products and demonstrating leadership to support and mentor team members. Increases in market share, consumer satisfaction, and product quality, while maintaining the highest compliance standards, are all within reach and present an exciting prospect to have a tangible impact on any industry I work in.

### Why Brisbane & Current Opportunity

I've recently immigrated to Australia from Germany. One of the main attractions was to join the vibrant Brisbane tech scene, and I believe that companies with stunning growth and an open mind towards next-generation AI workflows are perfectly aligned with my recent experience and philosophy for the future.

### Self-Awareness

My greatest weakness as an engineer is my attraction to new technologies. While during my career I've learned the importance of specialization and have become adept at using the right tools for the job, I sometimes need to consciously resist the urge to incorporate new technologies simply because they're interesting, rather than because they're the best solution for the current problem.
